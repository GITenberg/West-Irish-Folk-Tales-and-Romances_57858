<h2 id="INTRODUCTION"><i>INTRODUCTION.</i></h2>

<p>Whatever profit might, from the scientific
point of view, be considered likely
to spring from a study of Gaelic folk-lore,
it would probably be considered beforehand that
it would come from the study of the material
as a single body, uniform throughout, and, as
such, to be brought into comparison with the
folk-lore of other countries. When, however, we
come to an actual survey of the material, certain
appearances present themselves which lead us to
expect that, possibly, a large part of our gain will
accrue from the observation of the differences
which characterise different parts of the material
within itself. Ireland, though an island of
moderate extent, is yet sufficiently large to contain
districts far enough apart to isolate in some
degree their respective peasant populations; while
it is also admitted that the homogeneity of the
Gaelic tongue does not indicate a corresponding
homogeneity of race. It may turn out, in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
ultimately, that we have in Ireland, not one, but
several bodies of folk-lore placed in relations most
favourable for aiding in the solution of certain
problems; while, finally, we shall, by a comparison
with the Gaelic folk-lore of Scotland, obtain a still
wider field for similar observations and inferences.</p>

<p>It is true, unfortunately, that our Irish material
is not by any means what it might have been,
either in quantity or quality; its defects being
such that any conclusions arrived at through the
line of investigation here to be suggested must at
present be considered of a very provisional nature.
Of the folk-lore of the large province of Munster
we know next to nothing. I have myself hitherto
been able to make no attempt at collection in the
southern counties. Some of Mr. Curtin’s stories
were probably obtained in Kerry; but he has not
told us which. We have, therefore, nothing to fall
back upon but the somewhat sophisticated little
fairy tales of Crofton Croker. For Leinster, we
are better off, as we have the Wexford tales of
Kennedy. For the inland parts of Connaught we
have Dr. Hyde’s volume; for the coast of Connaught
and Donegal, the tales included in this
book, and many others in my possession not yet
published.</p>

<p>With regard to Crofton Croker’s tales, it needs
but a small acquaintance with Ireland to be
assured that they are not peculiar to Munster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
The cluricaun still pursues his trade of boot-making
by the shores of Achill Sound in Mayo.
Donegal knows all that the south ever knew on
the subject, and has perhaps even a greater wealth
of information. It is admitted that in the city of
Dublin the tribe does not now exist; but such is
not the case even in this highly-civilised watering-place
of Bray, only twelve miles distant from the
metropolis. In a word, this minor mythology
was, may we not say still is, common to the
whole island.</p>

<p>The fairies, however, do not very often form
the subjects of the longer detailed narratives.
Let me now turn to these. Among the Connaught
stories I have found a good many parallels
on the coast to those of the inland districts,
though I have not included any in this volume.
In Donegal, on the other hand, while I have
obtained only two partial variants of the inland
Connaught tales, I have found several close
parallels to the Connaught coast tales—a fact,
however, which may be accounted for by the
partially Donegalese descent of the Achill people.
If we now bring the Wexford tales into comparison,
it will be found that they do not contain
many parallels to those of the other districts. I
know of only five from Connaught, and two from
the more distant Donegal, both variants of two
of the Connaught tales, one of them, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
the best known of all such stories—no other,
indeed, than Mr. Lang’s “far-travelled tale”—that
of “The Three Tasks”; the other, of which
I obtained complete versions in Galway and in
Mayo, and which I know to exist in Donegal,
is represented in this volume by “Morraha Brian
More,” and in Kennedy by the “Fis fá an aon
Sgeul.” Now this latter does not appear to be
much known except in Ireland; but it will hardly
be contended that it was independently invented
in the four Irish counties in which it has been
discovered. Still less would this be maintained
regarding the other. The tale, which has proved
its popularity by flourishing in three quarters of
the globe, shows the same quality on a smaller
scale by flourishing in at least three provinces of
Ireland.</p>

<p>And perhaps this is the best place to note that
the theory of independent origin is contrary to
one of the closest analogies to be observed in
nature. When animals and plants of the same
species are found in wide-distant regions, no
naturalist assumes for a moment that they originated
separately. However puzzling the problem
may be, the student of nature seeks to solve it by
explanations of a very different kind; and already
many of the most difficult cases have yielded their
secret to patient investigation. It will assuredly
turn out to be the same with folk-tales. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
regards Ireland we see that there is a presumption,
which will scarcely be contested, in favour of the
view that certain entire tales were dispersed from
a common centre, thus showing on a small scale
the working of the whole process. When, however,
we come to parts of tales, such as special
phrases, rhymes, etc., the evidence of a common
origin is beyond question. There are plenty of
minor examples in this volume; but here I would
direct special attention to the three sea-runs which
occur in “Bioultach,” “King Mananaun,” and
“The Champion of the Red Belt,” found in Galway,
Mayo, and Donegal respectively (see <i>Note</i>,
<a href="#Page_253">pp. 253-4</a>). I think it difficult for any one who
reads these and notes their likenesses and their
differences, not to believe that they were originally
composed by one person. The variations are easily
accounted for by imperfect recollection, substitutions
for forgotten phrases, and all the gradual
alterations sure to arise in the case of irregular
oral transmission among peasant narrators.</p>

<p>The evidence, then, seems so far to show that
the fairy belief is common to all Ireland; that of
the more elaborate traditional narratives, a certain
small proportion seems to be widely diffused,
while the larger portion separates into divisions
peculiar to certain districts, the greatest divergence
between one locality and another occurring
when the localities are most widely separated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, that there should be any considerable
divergence seems surprising when the facts are
fully taken into account. Ireland is not a large
country. For centuries—we do not know how
many—before the Norman invasion, the inhabitants
had spoken Gaelic. The absence of political
unity, the ceaseless wars and forays, must all
have tended to fuse the population and obliterate
original differences much more than a settled state
of society. Yet they exist. The differences in
folk-lore are not greater than other differences.
Ethnologists know that the so-called Gaelic race
is really a compound one, containing in addition
to the true Celtic (Aryan) element probably two
that are not Aryan—a Mongolian or Finnish
element, and an Iberian element. Very little
attempt has hitherto been made to settle in what
parts of the country these elements respectively
preponderate; but that there must be some preponderance
of different races in different localities
is shown clearly enough by the varying physical
types. It is beyond question that Donegal differs
from Connaught, and that both differ from
Munster; and when we find that, in spite of a
coexistence of at least two thousand years in the
same island, and the possession of a common
language, different districts have a different folk-lore,
is it extravagant to surmise that these different
bodies are due to varying racial deposits?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now compare Ireland as a whole with
the Scotch Highlands. The language of both is
still, as for fifteen hundred years, practically the
same. The inhabitants are of closely-allied race,
in part identical, and for many centuries a constant
communication was kept up between both countries.
The folk-lore is partly alike, partly unlike.
The similarity is occasionally very great. There
are entire tales which are all but identical as told
on both sides of the sea. There is identity of
phrases and sentences. In Campbell’s version of
the “far-travelled tale,” “The Battle of the Birds,”
occurs a striking phrase, in which the raven is said
to have carried a man “over seven benns and
seven glens and seven mountain moors.” Nearly
the same phrase occurs in Kennedy’s version—“seven
mountains (benns), seven glens and seven
moors,” which is the more surprising, as this story
had passed, one does not know how long before,
from its Gaelic into its English dress. Compare
the phrase from “Morraha” in the present volume—“he
sat down and gave a groan and the chair
broke in pieces”—with Campbell’s “The King of
Assaroe”—“his heart was so heavy the chair broke
under him.” Many other examples could be
given. We have before our eyes, so far as Irish
and Scotch folk-lore are similar, an example of
how two branches of a race originally so closely
united as almost to form one, have for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
hundreds of years drifted or been forced apart,
the process being thus unfolded to us in the full
light of history by which a body of folk-lore,
originally one, has separated into divisions showing
distinct characteristics, while it retains the strongest
tokens of its original unity.</p>

<p>But it seems as if there was a large amount of
folk-literature in each country which the other
never possessed. To this I shall come presently,
after I have first brought forward a comparison
with German folk-lore. But before attempting
that, it is desirable first to offer a few remarks
on the style of the stories in this volume.</p>

<p>It will, I hope, be observed that the style is not
uniform, but that it differs considerably from one
story to another, and not so much in accordance
with the narrator as with what he narrates. I must
of course partially except the case of P. Minahan,
whose individuality is stamped on everything that
comes from him; but this is not so with the other
narrators. If “The Gloss Gavlen” be compared
with the only other tale of M’Ginty’s, “The King
who had Twelve Sons,” it will be seen that the
style of the two is quite distinct, the first being
noticeable for a certain archaic simplicity of which
there is no trace in the other. Again, the style
of “Bioultach” is surely quite different from that
of T. Davis’s other contribution, “The Story,” in
“Morraha,” while the opening of the latter from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
M’Grale is easily distinguishable from that of
“The Little Girl who got the better of the Gentleman,”
or “Gilla of the Enchantments.” Even
Minahan varies with his subject, as will appear from
a comparison of “The Woman who went to Hell”
with “The Champion of the Red Belt.” It seems
from this as if some of the tales had a certain
indestructibility of style, an original colour which
passed unaltered through the minds of perhaps
generations of reciters, this colour being determined
at first by the character of the subject. In
general, the tales of fierce fighting champions, of
the more terrible monsters, sorcerers and the like,
have a certain fierceness, if one may use the word,
of style; while those of more domestic incident
are told with quietness and tenderness.</p>

<p>Let me now briefly compare the folk-tales of
Germany with those of the Scotch Highlands.</p>

<p>It cannot, I think, escape notice in reading
Grimm’s collection, that a very large number of
the tales bear a strong impress of quiet domesticity.
They are very properly named “household” in
more senses than one. And this is a matter not
merely of style but of substance. The incidents
are, to a vast extent, domestic in character. There
is no occasion to give a long list of the tales I
refer to. I may mention as types “The Three
Spinners,” which turns entirely on the results of
domestic drudgery to the female figure; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
“Thrush-Beard,” a tale analogous to “The Taming
of the Shrew” legend. But this domestic stamp
becomes more fully apparent when we bring into
contrast the Highland stories. Among these there
are indeed parallels to Grimm; but they are relatively
few, and there is a whole class of incidents
and stories of which little trace is found in the
German collection. The domestic incident all but
disappears. The tales are more romantic, picturesque,
extravagant. The giants and monsters
are more frequent and fearful. The stories of
helping animals—and this is very characteristic—though
not entirely absent, are far less numerous
than in Grimm.</p>

<p>Now, turning to Ireland, we find that both
classes of story meet upon Irish soil. Without
making any allowance for the imperfect collection
of our folk-lore, and the quantity that must have
been lost owing to the lateness of our attempts to
rescue it, it must be admitted that we have the
domestic story fairly well developed. The two
tales from Grimm that I have named, as well as
many others, have the closest possible parallels in
Kennedy, and I have myself met with additional
examples on the coast of Connaught. The
romantic and extravagant class of tales which
flourish in the Highlands have also good representatives
in our oral literature. Some specimens
may be read in this volume. In one story, “Gilla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
of the Enchantments,” is found a striking combination
of the two. The story is, in part, a close
variant of Kennedy’s “Twelve Wild Geese,” but
it also contains, in addition to other matter, the
wild incident of the daily cutting off of the
brothers’ heads by the sister, which is equally
wanting in the variant to be found in Grimm.</p>

<p>The question now arises, How are these contrasts
and similarities to be accounted for? Must
we suppose them to be due to mere accident? If
not, what law has been at work? Why have
different kinds of tales drifted in different directions?
What current of distribution has carried
one set of tales to Scotland, part of the same and
part of a different set to Ireland, while Germany
has received a much larger share of the latter than
Ireland, though in the other she has been left
poor? It is clearly not commercial intercourse
that has been at work, nor exogamy, nor slavery.
Some other agency has to be sought for.</p>

<p>In the case of ancient Greece we have an
instance in which an exceptionally rich body of
legend has been proved to consist of elements
brought from divers nations and races. The
birthplace of many of the most considerable personages
in Greek mythology has been found in
Asian lands. The Centaurs, Perseus, Dionysus
and Semele, Artemis, Adonis and Aphrodite herself,
are believed to be all Asiatic in origin. Nay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
more. These Orientals are shown to belong to
two distinct races commingled in Babylonia: the
Semites, who may have had distant affinities with
the Iberians of the West; and the Accadians, whose
connections were Mongol. It is true that the
Greeks are held to have received these additions
to their own store by means of commercial intercourse.
The Phœnicians, those restless honey-gatherers
of the old Mediterranean world, went
about everywhere fertilising Western flowers with
Eastern pollen; but in the case of the wild and
barbarous north-west a similar agency cannot be
found; and while we are justified in taking the
hint supplied by the discovery of the compound
racial nature of Greek myth, we are compelled by
circumstances to seek for a different solution of
the problem.</p>

<p>I have already adverted to the differences of
race which exist in Ireland, more or less masked
by the long predominance of the Aryan Gael.
Such differences are not confined to Ireland. It
is now admitted that the apparent predominance
of the Aryan over most of Europe is, to a great
extent, one of language merely. Furthermore,
the elements which make up our population are
found everywhere; the differences, mental and
physical, which characterise different nations,
being mainly due, first, to the minor variations
which mark the branches of the great stocks, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
as Celt, Teuton, and Slav among the Aryans, and
secondly, to the continually varying proportions
in which the different elements are blended. The
principal fact is, that far the larger part of the Old
World, excluding Africa, is occupied by three or
four varieties of man, such as the Aryan, the
Mongol, and the Iberian; the others, even when
as important as the Semitic, holding very limited
areas, and subject to continual contact with those
more predominant. Of these again, it is worthy
of remark that the most widely spread is not the
Aryan, but the Mongol. The latter, in addition
to the vast regions which are his openly, such as
Japan, China, Central Asia, and his outlying posts
in Europe, Finland, Hungary, and Turkey, is
recognised by the type as leading a masked existence
in the most western portions of our quarter
of the globe. “Scratch the Russian and you will
find the Tartar” is a saying which may be applied,
<i>mutatis mutandis</i>, to many a nation much more
remote from Central Asia; nor can we be surprised
that such should be the case when we call to mind
that this powerful branch of mankind has actually,
within recent historical times, run the Aryan a neck-and-neck
race for outward supremacy, while to the
Semites he has scarcely left even their deserts.</p>

<p>With regard to the Iberian race, it has only to
be noted that its distribution in the south and
west of Europe is very extensive. It is still almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
wholly predominant in Spain and Portugal. It
probably constituted in old times, as now, the
main non-Aryan element in Mediterranean Europe.
North-westward it has had a wide extension into
France, Britain, and Ireland, and probably into
Scandinavia and other countries; while it is not
impossible that to it also belong in part the non-Aryan
inhabitants of Hindustan.</p>

<p>Applying these facts to Germany, the Scotch
Highlands, and Ireland, do we not obtain a hint
as to the phenomenon of folk-lore distribution?
One race, let us say mainly Aryan, in Germany;
another race, much less Aryan, in the Scotch
Highlands; a third, a more even blend of the two—of
Aryan and non-Aryan—in Ireland.</p>

<p>This theory seems to me to be only such a
modification of a theory which originally prevailed
as is now required by the facts. It was
at first believed, apparently is still believed by
some, that all these tales originally belonged to
the Aryans alone. As soon, however, as it was
found that many of them were the possession of
races far removed from Aryan contact, it was
at once seen that a modification of view was
imperative. Then came the independent origin
theory; and, amongst others of later birth, one
which has recently attracted much attention—the
Indian theory. This seems to me to involve
the truth of several propositions which are surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
a little hard to accept. We must hold, first, that
the Aryans, when they entered India, had no folk-tales,
because, according to the hypothesis, they
carried none elsewhere; next, that the tales were
either invented by the Aryans after they entered
India, or were learned by them from the earlier
peoples of that country. But that tales of one
country, or one race, should have had a peculiar
ability to diffuse themselves, wanting to all others,
is a proposition that tries one’s faith. Reverting
again to the analogy already used, we know that
there are animals common to India and Ireland
whose original home was in neither country.
There are men of the same Aryan descent by
the Shannon and by the Indus whose ancestors
had not their first common habitation by either
river. And the folk-tales, so far as they are
Aryan, did not originate south of the Himalayas,
or west of the Irish Sea. But they cannot all
be Aryan. Nothing could antecedently be more
improbable than the suggestion that they were;
and we might fairly regard it as refuted even if we
had nothing to go on but the literary character of
the tales. They bear the stamp of the genius of
more than one race. The pure and placid but
often cold imagination of the Aryan has been at
work on some. In others we trace the more picturesque
fancy, the fierceness and sensuality, the
greater sense of artistic elegance belonging to races<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
whom the Aryan, in spite of his occasional faults
of hardness and coarseness, has, on the whole, left
behind him. But as the greatest results in the
realm of the highest art have always been achieved
in the case of certain blends of Aryan with other
blood, I should hardly deem it extravagant if it
were asserted that in the humbler regions of the
folk-tale we might trace the working of the same
law. The process which has gone on may in
part have been as follows:—Every race which has
acquired very definite characteristics must have
been for a long time isolated. The Aryans,
during their period of isolation, probably developed
many of their folk-germs into their larger myths,
owing to the greater constructiveness of their
imagination, and thus, in a way, they used up part
of their material. Afterwards, when they became
blended with other races less advanced, they acquired
fresh material to work on. We have in
Ireland an instance to hand, of which a brief discussion
may help to illustrate the whole race theory.</p>

<p>The larger Irish legendary literature divides
itself into three cycles—the divine, the heroic, the
Fenian. Of these three the last is so well known
orally in Scotland that it has been a matter of
dispute to which country it really belongs. It
belongs, in fact, to both. Here, however, comes
in a strange contrast with the other cycles. The
first is, so far as I am aware, wholly unknown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
Scotland, the second comparatively unknown.
What is the explanation? Professor Zimmer
not having established his late-historical view as
regards Fionn, and the general opinion among
scholars having tended of recent years towards
the mythical view, we want to know why there
is so much more community in one case than in
the other. Mr. O’Grady long since seeing this
difficulty, and then believing Fionn to be historical,
was induced to place the latter in point of time
before Cuchullin and his compeers. But this view
is, of course, inadmissible when Fionn is seen not
to be historical at all. There remains but one
explanation. The various bodies of legend in
question are, so far as Ireland is concerned, only
earlier or later as they came into the island with
the various races to which they belonged. The
wider prevalence, then, of the Fionn Saga would
indicate that it belonged to an early race occupying
both Ireland and Scotland. Then entered the
Aryan Gael, and for him, henceforth, as the ruler
of the island, his own gods and heroes were sung
by his own bards. His legends became the
subject of what I may call the court poetry,
the aristocratic literature. When he conquered
Scotland, he took with him his own gods and
heroes; but in the latter country the bardic
system never became established, and hence we
find but feeble echoes of the heroic cycle among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
the mountains of the North. That this is the
explanation is shown by what took place in Ireland.
Here the heroic cycle has been handed down in
remembrance almost solely by the bardic literature.
The popular memory retains but few traces of it.
Its essentially aristocratic character is shown by
the fact that the people have all but forgotten it
if they ever knew it. But the Fenian cycle has
not been forgotten. Prevailing everywhere, still
cherished by the conquered peoples, it held its
ground in Scotland and Ireland alike, forcing its
way in the latter country even into the written
literature, and so securing a twofold lease of
existence. That it did not deserve this wider
popularity is evident enough. Interesting though
it be, it is not equal in interest to the heroic cycle.
The tales of the latter, though fewer in number,
less bulky in amount, have upon them the impress
of the larger constructive sweep of the Aryan
imagination. Their characters are nobler; the
events are more significant. They form a much
more closely compacted epic whole. The Fenian
tales, in some respects more picturesque, are less
organised. It would be difficult to construct out
of them a coherent epic plot; and what is,
perhaps, not the least in significance, they have far
more numerous, more extended, more intimate
connections with the folk-tale.</p>

<p>The Fenian cycle, in a word, is non-Aryan folk-literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
partially subjected to Aryan treatment.
It occupies accordingly a middle position. Above
the rank of the folk-tale it has been elevated;
but to the dignity of the heroic legend it has not
attained.</p>

<p class="tb">The tales included in the present volume form
part of a large collection, which I began to make as
far back as the year 1884. All have been taken
down in the same way—that is to say, word for
word from the dictation of the peasant narrators,
all by myself, with the exception of two taken
down by Mr. Lecky in precisely similar fashion;
difficult and doubtful parts being gone over again
and again. Sometimes the narrators can explain
difficulties. Sometimes other natives of the place
can help you. But after every resource of this
kind has been exhausted, a certain number of
doubtful words and phrases remain, with regard
to which—well, one can only do one’s best.</p>

<p>The districts from which the tales were obtained
are three in number, each represented by two
narrators. Renvyle, the most southern of the
three, is situated in Connemara. It is a narrow
peninsula, forming the extreme north-western
point of the county of Galway, jutting out opposite
Mayo. Terence Davis is a labourer pure
and simple, a man of about forty-five years of
age, and blind of one eye. Some of his tales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
he got from his mother. Michael Faherty was,
when I first made his acquaintance, a lad of about
seventeen. He was recommended, as the best
pupil in the National School, to Mr. Lecky, who,
finding him intelligent, selected him as the best
person from whom, on account of his youth, the
very latest development of the language could be
learnt. He lived with his uncle, who had, or has
still, a small holding on the Blake property, and
who was also a pilot and repairer of boats. Both
his tales were taken down by Mr. Lecky. Next
in order, going northward, comes Achill Island,
distant some twenty-five miles from Renvyle by
sea, more than sixty miles by land.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Two narrators
from that locality are also represented in
the book. One of them, Pat. M’Grale, is a man
of middle age, a cottier with a small holding, and
besides, a Jack-of-all-trades, something of a boatman
and fisherman, “a botch of a tailor,” to use
his own words, and ready for any odd job. He
can read Irish, but had very little literature on
which to exercise his accomplishment. He knows
some long poems by heart, and is possessed of
various odds and ends of learning, accurate and
not. John M’Ginty, a man of Donegal descent
and name, has also some land; but his holding is
so small that he is to a great extent a labourer for
others, and was engaged on relief works when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
first came to know him. He, also, is a middle-aged
man. He knows many Ossianic poems by
heart, which, he told me, his father taught him,
verse by verse.</p>

<p>Glencolumkill is the extreme south-west corner
of Donegal, remote, like Achill and Renvyle. It
is chiefly represented by the tales of Pat. Minahan,
from whom I obtained more stories than from
any other one man. He said he was eighty years
of age; but he was in full possession of all his
faculties. He also had a holding on which he
still worked industriously. He had no children;
but his nephew, who lived with him, made up
for all deficiencies of that nature. His style, with
its short, abrupt sentences, is always remarkable,
and at its best I think excellent. Jack Gillespie,
known as Jack-Anne—the latter his mother’s name—to
distinguish him from other Jack Gillespies,
was a man of sixty or over, also a cottier.</p>

<p>The tales were written down in places sufficiently
varied;—from the Renvyle library to the
neat little farmhouse parlour at Malinmore, where
I spent so many a winter’s evening, solitary but
for the occasional visits of some one or other of
my story-tellers;—from little smoky cabins, with
inquisitive hens hopping on the table, to the
unroofed freedom of rock or brae, under
summer skies, by those thrice-lovely shores of
Renvyle; by the scarcely less beautiful, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
far more rugged, crags and cliffs of Achill;
by “the wild sea-banks” of what has been
described as the “grandest coast in Europe”—that
of Glencolumkill.</p>

<p>The beauty of Scotch scenery has been discovered
by one critic to be reflected in the
picturesqueness of the Scotch tales. I am not
without hope that a like influence has contributed
something of a like quality to those now submitted
to the reader.</p>

<p>The Gobaun Seer and his son went eastward
to the eastern world to Balar Beimann to
make for him a palace. “Shorten the road, my
son,” said the father. The son ran out before him
on the road, and the father returned home on that
day. The second day they went travelling, and
the father told his son to shorten the road. He
ran out in front of his father the second day, and
the father returned home.</p>

<p>“What’s the cause of your returning home like
that?” said the wife of the young Gobaun.</p>

<p>“My father asks me to shorten the road. I
run out on the road before him, and he returns.”</p>

<p>“Do you begin to-morrow at a story he has
never heard, and I’ll go bail he will not return.
And do you never be in any place that the women
are not on your side.”</p>

<p>They went travelling the third day, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
young Gobaun began at a story his father never
heard, and he returned no more till they came to
the eastern world. Then they made the palace for
Balar Beimann, and he did not wish to let them
go back, for fear they should make for another
man a palace as good as his.</p>

<p>“Take away the scaffolding” (said he); for he
wanted to let them die on the top of the building.
Balar Beimann had a girl, who went by under the
building in the morning.</p>

<p>“Young Gobaun,” said she, “go on thy
wisdom. I think it is easier to throw seven
stones down than to put one up as far as
you.”</p>

<p>“That’s true for you,” said young Gobaun.</p>

<p>They began to let down the work. When
Balar Beimann heard that they were throwing
down the works, he ordered back the scaffolding
till they were down on the ground.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the old Gobaun Seer, “there is a
crookedness in your work, and if I had three
tools I left after me at home, I would straighten
the work, and there would not be any work in
the world to compare with it. The names of
the tools are—Crooked against Crooked, Corner
against Corner, and Engine against deceit;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and
there is not a man to get them but your own son.
You will find,” said he, “a woman with one hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and a child with one eye, in the house, and a stack
of corn at the door.”</p>

<p>The father then gave him a ship and sent him
over to Erin. He was travelling ever till he
found out the house; and he went into it. He
asked if that was the house of young Gobaun.
The woman said it was.</p>

<p>“He said to me there was a woman with one
hand, and a child with one eye in the house, and
a stack of corn at the door.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see,” said she, “that I have only
one hand, and don’t you see this stick in the hand
of the child? I don’t know what moment he
won’t put it in his eye and take the eye out of
himself; and don’t you see the stack of corn
outside at the door?”</p>

<p>He asked then for the three tools.</p>

<p>“What three tools?” said she.</p>

<p>“They are Corner against Corner, Crooked
against Crooked, and Engine against deceit.”</p>

<p>She understood then that they (<i>i.e.</i> her husband
and his father) would never come home, if she
did not understand these words.</p>

<p>“The three tools that are called Crooked against
Crooked, Corner against Corner, and Engine against
deceit, they are down in this chest.”</p>

<p>She went then and opened the chest, and told
him to stoop down to the bottom, that she was not
tall enough. He stooped, and when she got him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
bent down, she threw him into the chest and
closed it, and told him he should stay there till
young Gobaun and old Gobaun came home and
their pay for their service with them.</p>

<p>She sent word to Balar Beimann that she had
his son in confinement, till young Gobaun and old
Gobaun came home. He gave them a ship and
sent them home with their pay; and she let Balar
Beimann’s son back to him again. When they
were going home, Balar asked Gobaun what smith
would he get to put irons on his palace.</p>

<p>“There is no smith in Erin better than Gavidjeen
Go.”</p>

<p>When the old Gobaun came home he told
Gavidjeen Go to take no pay from him for putting
the irons on his palace, except the Gloss:</p>

<p>“If twenty barrels were put under her, she
would fill the twenty barrels.”</p>

<p>Balar Beimann then wrote to the Gavidjeen Go
that he would give him the Gloss if he would
make irons for his palace. But when he sent the
Gloss, he did not give the byre-rope, and he knew
that when he did not give that, she would go
from him.</p>

<p>This is the bargain that Gavidjeen Go made
then with every champion that came to him:—to
mind the cow and bring her safe home to him
at evening; he would make a sword for every
champion who would mind her. She would pasture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
in the daytime at Cruahawn, of Connaught,
and drink at Loch Ayachir-a-Guigalu, in Ulster,
in the evening.</p>

<p>Kian, the son of Contje, came to him to have
a sword made. He told him he would make it,
but that the bargain would be to mind the Gloss
that day.</p>

<p>“If she is not home with you to me in the evening,
you must lay down your head on the anvil,
that I may cut it off with your own sword.”</p>

<p>Kian, the son of Contje, went then and took
hold of her by the tail. When he came home in
the evening, “Here is the Gloss outside,” said he
to Gavidjeen Go. There was a champion inside
in the forge, whose name was the Laughing
Knight. He ran out and said to Kian:</p>

<p>“The smith is about to put tempering on your
sword, and unless you have hold of it, there will
be no power in it when you wield it.”</p>

<p>When Kian, the son of Contje, went in, he
forgot to drive in the Gloss. Gavidjeen Go
asked him, “Where is the Gloss?”</p>

<p>“There she is, outside the door.”</p>

<p>“Put her in,” said he.</p>

<p>When he went out she was gone.</p>

<p>“Lay down your head upon the anvil, that I
may cut it off you.”</p>

<p>“I am asking of you the favour of three days,
to go and seek her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will give you that,” said he.</p>

<p>He went with himself then, and was following
her tracks till he came to the sea. He was up
and down on the shore, plucking his hair from
his head, in trouble after the Gloss. There was
a man out on the sea in a currach. He rowed
in to him. It was the tawny Mananaun, the son
of Lir. He asked him—</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you to-day?”</p>

<p>He told him.</p>

<p>“How much will you give to any one who will
leave you in the place where the Gloss is?”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to give him.”</p>

<p>“I will ask nothing of you, but the half of all
you gain till you come back.”</p>

<p>“I will give you that,” said Kian, son of
Contje.</p>

<p>“Be into the currach.”</p>

<p>In the winking of an eye he left him over in
the kingdoms of the cold; nor on that island was
a morsel cooked ever, but they ate every kind of
food raw. Kian, son of Contje, made a fire, and
began to cook his food. When Balar Beimann
heard the like was there, he took him to be his
cook, his story-teller, and his fireman. Well,
Balar Beimann had one daughter, and a prediction
was made that she would have a son, who would
kill his grandfather. He then put her into prison
for fear a man would come near her; and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
he himself who would go to her with food, and
the companion with her was a dummy woman.
Mananaun left this enchantment with Kian, son
of Contje, that any lock he laid his hand on
would open and shut after him. He was looking
at Balar Beimann going to this house, to his
daughter, with food for her, and he went himself
after him to the house, and he laid his hand on
the lock and opened the door, and found none
but the two women there. He made a fire for
them. He was coming there ever, till a child
happened to her. He was then going to depart,
when the boy was born. He went to the king
and told him he must depart.</p>

<p>“Why are you going?” said he.</p>

<p>“It is because accidents have happened to me
since I came into this island. I must go.”</p>

<p>“What is the accident?” said he.</p>

<p>“A child has happened to me.”</p>

<p>Balar had two sons on another island learning
druidism. They came home to the palace to their
father.</p>

<p>“Father,” said a man of them, “your story-teller,
your cook, and your fireman will give you
your sufficiency of trouble.”</p>

<p>Kian, son of Contje, was listening to them
speaking. He went to the daughter of Balar
Beimann, and told her what her brother said.</p>

<p>“Well,” said she, “it is now time for you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
be going. That is the byre-rope of the Gloss,
hanging on the wall. She will be as quick as
you; and take with you the boy.”</p>

<p>He went then till he came to the place where
Mananaun put him out. Mananaun told him,
when he was in difficulty, to think of him and
he would come. He now came on the instant.</p>

<p>“Be in the currach,” said Mananaun, “and
make haste, or Balar Beimann will drown us, if
he can. But greater is my druidism than his,”
said the tawny Mananaun, the son of Lir.</p>

<p>He jumped into the currach, and the Gloss
jumped in as soon as he. Balar Beimann followed
them, and raised the sea in a storm before them
and behind them, nor did Mananaun aught but
stretch out his hand and make the sea calm.
Balar then set fire to the sea before them in hopes
of burning them, but Mananaun threw out a stone,
and extinguished the sea.</p>

<p>“Now, Kian, son of Contje, you are safe and
sound home, and what will you give me for it?”</p>

<p>“I have nothing but the boy, and we will not
go to make two halves of him, but I will give
him to you entirely.”</p>

<p>“I am thankful to you. That is what I was
wanting. There will be no champion in the
world as good as he,” said Mananaun.</p>

<p>This is the name that Mananaun baptized him
with—the Dul Dauna. He brought him up with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
feats of activity and championship. He and
Mananaun were out one day on the sea, and they
saw the fleet of Balar Beimann sailing. The Dul
Dauna put a ring to his eye, and he saw his
grandfather on the deck walking, but he did not
know it was his grandfather. He (took) a dart
from his pocket and flung it at him and killed
him. The prophecy was then fulfilled.</p>

<h2 id="MORRAHA"><i>MORRAHA,
BRIAN MORE, SON OF THE HIGH-KING OF ERIN FROM
THE WELL OF ENCHANTMENTS OF BINN EDIN.</i></h2>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">P. McGrale</span>, Dugort, Achill Island, co. Mayo.</i></p>

<p>Morraha rose in the morning and washed
his hands and face, and said his prayers,
and ate his food; and he asked God to prosper
the day for him; and he went down to the brink
of the sea, and he saw a currach, short and
green, coming towards him; and in it there was
but one youthful champion, and he playing hurly
from prow to stern of the currach. He had a
hurl of gold and a ball of silver; and he stopped
not till the currach was in on the shore; and he
drew her up on the green grass, and put fastening
on her for a day and a year, whether he should
be there all that time or should only be on land
for an hour by the clock. And Morraha saluted
the young man in words intelligent, intelligible,
such as (were spoken) at that time; and the other
saluted him in the same fashion, and asked him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
would he play a game of cards with him; and
Morraha said that he had not the wherewithal;
and the other answered that he was never without
a candle or the making of it; and he put his hand
in his pocket and drew out a table and two chairs
and a pack of cards, and they sat down on the
chairs and went to the card-playing. The first
game Morraha won, and the slender red champion
bade him make his claim; and he said that
the land above him should be filled with stock
of sheep in the morning. It was well; and he
played no second game, but home he went.</p>

<p>The next day Morraha went to the brink of
the sea, and the young man came in the currach
and asked him would he play cards; and they
played; and Morraha won. And the young man
bade him make his claim; and he said that the
land above should be filled with cattle in the
morning. It was well; and he played no other
game, but went home.</p>

<p>And on the third morning Morraha went to
the brink of the sea, and he saw the young man
coming. And he drew up his boat on the shore
and asked him would he play cards. And they
played, and Morraha won the game; and the
young man bade him give his claim. And he
said he should have a castle and of women the
finest and the fairest; and they were his. It
was well; and the young man went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>On the fourth day the woman asked him how
he had found himself, and he told her. “And
I am going out” (said he) “to play again to-day.”</p>

<p>“I cross” (forbid) “you to go again to him.
If you have won so much, you will lose more;
and have no more to do with him.”</p>

<p>But he went against her will, and he saw the
currach coming; and the young man was driving
his balls from end to end of the currach; he had
balls of silver and a hurl of gold, and he stopped
not till he drew his boat on the shore, and made
her fast for a year and a day. And Morraha
and he saluted each other; and he asked Morraha
if he would play a game of cards, and they played,
and he won. And Morraha said to him, “Give
your claim now.”</p>

<p>Said he, “You will hear it too soon. I lay on
you the bonds of the art of the druid, not to sleep
two nights in one house, nor finish a second meal
at the one table, till you bring me the sword of
light and news of the death of Anshgayliacht.”</p>

<p>He went home to his wife and sat down in
a chair, and gave a groan, and the chair broke in
pieces.</p>

<p>“It is the son of a king under spells you are,”
said his wife; “and you had better have taken
my counsel than that the spells should be on
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>He said to her to bring news of the death
of Anshgayliacht and the sword of light to the
slender red champion.</p>

<p>“Go out,” said she, “in the morning of the
morrow, and take the bridle in the window, and
shake it; and whatever beast, handsome or ugly,
puts the head in it, take that one with you. Do
not speak a word to her till she speaks to you;
and take with you three pint bottles of ale and
three sixpenny loaves, and do the thing she tells
you; and when she runs to my father’s land, on
a height above the court, she will shake herself,
and the bells will ring, and my father will say
Brown Allree is in the land. And if the son of a
king or queen is there, bring him to me on your
shoulders; but if it is the son of a poor man, let
him come no further.”</p>

<p>He rose in the morning, and took the bridle
that was in the window, and went out and shook
it; and Brown Allree came and put her head in
it. And he took the three loaves and three
bottles of ale, and went riding; and when he
was riding she bent her head down to take hold
of her feet with her mouth, in hopes he would
speak in ignorance; but he spoke not a word
during the time, and the mare at last spoke
to him, and said to him to dismount and give
her her dinner. He gave her the sixpenny loaf
toasted, and a bottle of ale to drink. “Sit up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
now riding, and take good heed of yourself:
there are three miles of fire I have to clear at a
leap.”</p>

<p>She cleared the three miles of fire at a leap,
and asked if he were riding, and he said he was.
They went on then, and she told him to dismount
and give her a meal; and he did so, and gave
her a sixpenny loaf and a bottle; and she consumed
them, and said to him there were before
them three miles of hill covered with steel thistles,
and that she must clear it. And she cleared the
hill with a leap, and she asked him if he were
still riding, and he said he was. They went on,
and she went not far before she told him to give
her a meal, and he gave her the bread and the
bottleful. And she went over three miles of sea
with a leap, and she came then to the land of
the King of France; and she went up on a height
above the castle, and she shook herself and neighed,
and the bells rang; and the king said that it was
Brown Allree was in the land. “Go out,” said
he, “and if it is the son of a king or queen, carry
him in on your shoulders; if it is not, leave him
there.”</p>

<p>They went out; and the stars of the son of a
king were on his breast; and they lifted him high
on their shoulders and bore him in to the king.
And they passed the night cheerfully, with playing
and with drinking, with sport and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
diversion, till the whiteness of the day came upon
the morrow morning.</p>

<p>Then the young king told the cause of his
journey, and he asked of the queen her counsel
and consent, and to give him counsel and good
luck, and the woman told him everything she
advised him to do. “Go now,” said she, “and
take with you the best mare in the stable, and
go to the door of Rough Niall of the speckled
rock, and knock, and call on him to give you
news of the death of Anshgayliacht and the sword
of light; and let the horse’s back be to the door,
and apply the spurs, and away with you.”</p>

<p>And in the morning he did so, and he took
the best horse from the stable and rode to the
door of Niall, and turned the horse’s back to
the door, and demanded news of the death of
Anshgayliacht and the sword of light; and he
applied the spurs, and away with him. And Niall
followed him, and, as he was passing the gate, cut
the horse in two. And the mother was there with
a dish of puddings and flesh, and she threw it
in his eyes and blinded him, and said, “Fool,
whatever kind of man it is that’s mocking you,
isn’t that a fine condition you have got on your
father’s horse?”</p>

<p>On the morning of the next day, Morraha rose,
and took another horse from the stable, and went
again to the door of Niall, and knocked and demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
news of the death of Anshgayliacht and
the sword of light, and applied the spurs to the
horse and away with him. And Niall followed,
and as he was passing the gate, cut the horse in
two and took half the saddle with him; and his
mother met him and threw the flesh in his eyes
and blinded him.</p>

<p>And on the third day, Morraha went also to
the door of Niall; and Niall followed him, and as
he was passing the gate, cut away the saddle from
under him and the clothes from his back. Then
his mother said to Niall,—</p>

<p>“Whatever fool it is that’s mocking you, he is
out yonder in the little currach, going home; and
take good heed to yourself, and don’t sleep one
wink for three days.”</p>

<p>And for three days the little currach was there
before him, and then his mother came to him and
said,—</p>

<p>“Sleep as much as you want now. He is
gone.”</p>

<p>And he went to sleep, and there was heavy
sleep on him, and Morraha went in and took hold
of the sword that was on the bed at his head.
And the sword thought to draw itself out of the
hand of Morraha; but it failed. And then it
gave a cry, and it wakened Niall, and Niall said it
was a rude and rough thing to come into his house
like that; and said Morraha to him,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Leave your much talking, or I will cut the
head off you. Tell me the news of the death of
Anshgayliacht.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can have my head.”</p>

<p>“But your head is no good to me; tell me the
story.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Niall’s wife, “you must get the
story.”</p>

<p>“Oh” [said Morraha], “is the woman your
wife?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the man, “it is not you who have
the story.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said she, “you will tell it to us.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the man, “let us sit down together
till I tell the story. I thought no one would ever
get it; but now it will be heard by all.”</p>

<h3>THE STORY.</h3>

<p class="by">(<i>The Story is from the narrative of <span class="smcap">Terence Davis</span>, of
Renvyle, co. Galway.</i>)</p>

<p>When I was growing up, my mother taught me
the language of the birds; and when I got married,
I used to be listening to their conversation; and
I would be laughing; and my wife would be
asking me what was the reason of my laughing,
but I did not like to tell her, as women are always
asking questions. We went out walking one fine
morning, and the birds were arguing with one
another. One of them said to another,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why should you be making comparison with
me, when there is not a king nor knight that does
not come to look at my tree?”</p>

<p>“Oh, what advantage has your tree over mine,
on which there are three rods of magic and mastery
growing?”</p>

<p>When I heard them arguing, and knew that the
rods were there, I began to laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh,” asked my wife, “why are you always
laughing? I believe it is at myself you are jesting,
and I’ll walk with you no more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is not about you I am laughing. It
is because I understand the language of the
birds.”</p>

<p>Then I had to tell her what the birds were
saying to one another; and she was greatly delighted,
and she asked me to go home, and she
gave orders to the cook to have breakfast ready at
six o’clock in the morning. I did not know why
she was going out early, and breakfast was ready
in the morning at the hour she appointed. She
asked me to go out walking. I went with her.
She went to the tree, and asked me to cut a rod
for her.</p>

<p>“Oh, I will not cut it. Are we not better
without it?”</p>

<p>“I will not leave this until I get the rod, to see
if there is any good in it.”</p>

<p>I cut the rod and gave it to her. She turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
from me and struck a blow on a stone, and
changed it; and she struck a second blow on
me, and made of me a black raven, and she
went home and left me after her. I thought she
would come back; she did not come, and I had
to go into a tree till morning. In the morning,
at six o’clock, there was a bellman out, proclaiming
that every one who killed a raven would
get a fourpenny bit. At last you would not find
man or boy without a gun, nor, if you were to
walk three miles, a raven that was not killed. I
had to make a nest in the top of the parlour
chimney, and hide myself all day till night came,
and go out to pick up a bit to support me, till
I spent a month. Here she is herself (to say)
if it is a lie I am telling.</p>

<p>“It is not,” said she.</p>

<p>Then I saw her out walking. I went up to
her, and I thought she would turn me back to
my own shape, and she struck me with the rod
and made of me an old white horse, and she
ordered me to be put to a cart with a man, to
draw stones from morning till night. I was
worse off then. She spread abroad a report that
I had died suddenly in my bed, and prepared a
coffin, and waked and buried me. Then she had
no trouble. But when I got tired I began to kill
every one who came near me, and I used to go
into the haggard every night and destroy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
stacks of corn; and when a man came near me
in the morning I would follow him till I broke
his bones. Every one got afraid of me. When
she saw I was doing mischief she came to meet
me, and I thought she would change me. And
she did change me, and made a fox of me.
When I saw she was doing me every sort of
damage I went away from her. I knew there
was a badger’s hole in the garden, and I went
there till night came, and I made great slaughter
among the geese and ducks. There she is herself
to say if I am telling a lie.</p>

<p>“Oh! you are telling nothing but the truth,
only less than the truth.”</p>

<p>When she had enough of my killing the fowl
she came out into the garden, for she knew I
was in the badger’s hole. She came to me and
made me a wolf. I had to be off, and go to an
island, where no one at all would see me, and
now and then I used to be killing sheep, for there
were not many of them, and I was afraid of being
seen and hunted; and so I passed a year, till a
shepherd saw me among the sheep, and a pursuit
was made after me. And when the dogs came
near me there was no place for me to escape to
from them; but I recognised the sign of the
king among the men, and I made for him, and
the king cried out to stop the hounds. I took
a leap upon the front of the king’s saddle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the woman behind cried out, “My king and my
lord, kill him, or he will kill you!”</p>

<p>“Oh! he will not kill me. He knew me;
he must be pardoned.”</p>

<p>And the king took me home with him, and
gave orders I should be well cared for. I was
so wise, when I got food, I would not eat one
morsel until I got a knife and fork. The man
told the king, and the king came to see if it was
true, and I got a knife and fork, and I took the
knife in one paw and the fork in the other, and
I bowed to the king. The king gave orders to
bring him drink, and it came; and the king
filled a glass of wine and gave it to me.</p>

<p>I took hold of it in my paw and drank it, and
thanked the king.</p>

<p>“Oh, on my honour, it is some king or other
has lost him, when he came on the island; and I
will keep him, as he is trained; and perhaps he
will serve us yet.”</p>

<p>And this is the sort of king he was,—a king who
had not a child living. Eight sons were born to
him and three daughters, and they were stolen the
same night they were born. No matter what
guard was placed over them, the child would be
gone in the morning. The queen was now
carrying the twelfth child, and when she was
lying in the king took me with him to watch the
baby. The women were not satisfied with me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh,” said the king, “what was all your
watching ever? One that was born to me I have
not; and I will leave this one in the dog’s care,
and he will not let it go.”</p>

<p>A coupling was put between me and the
cradle, and when every one went to sleep I was
watching till the person woke who attended in
the daytime; but I was there only two nights,
when it was near the day, I saw the hand
coming down through the chimney, and the
hand was so big that it took round the child
altogether, and thought to take him away. I
caught hold of the hand above the wrist, and as
I was fastened to the cradle, I did not let go my
hold till I cut the hand from the wrist, and there
was a howl from the person without. I laid the
hand in the cradle with the child, and as I
was tired I fell asleep; and when I awoke, I had
neither child nor hand; and I began to howl, and
the king heard me, and he cried out that something
was wrong with me, and he sent servants to
see what was the matter with me, and when the
messenger came, he saw me covered with blood,
and he could not see the child; and he went to
the king and told him the child was not to be
got. The king came and saw the cradle coloured
with the blood, and he cried out “where was the
child gone?” and every one said it was the dog
had eaten it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The king said: “It is not: loose him, and he
will get the pursuit himself.”</p>

<p>When I was loosed, I found the scent of the
blood till I came to a door of the room in which
the child was. I went to the king and took hold
of him, and went back again and began to tear at
the door. The king followed me and asked for
the key. The servant said it was in the room of
the stranger woman. The king caused search to
be made for her, and she was not to be found. “I
will break the door,” said the king, “as I can’t
get the key.” The king broke the door, and I
went in, and went to the trunk, and the king
asked for a key to unlock it. He got no key,
and he broke the lock. When he opened the
trunk, the child and the hand were stretched side
by side, and the child was asleep. The king took
the hand and ordered a woman to come for the
child, and he showed the hand to every one in
the house. But the stranger woman was gone,
and she did not see the king; and here she is
herself (to say) if I am telling lies of her.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s nothing but the truth you have!”</p>

<p>The king did not allow me to be tied any more.
He said there was nothing so much to wonder at
as that I cut the hand off, and I tied.</p>

<p>The child was growing till he was a year old.
And he was beginning to walk, and there was no
one caring for him more than I was. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
growing till he was three, and he was running out
every minute; so the king ordered a silver chain
to be put between me and the child, so that he
might not go away from me. I was out with
him in the garden every day, and the king was
as proud as the world of the child. He would
be watching him every place we went, till the
child grew so wise that he would loose the chain
and get off. But one day that he loosed it I
failed to find him; and I ran into the house and
searched the house, but there was no getting him
for me. The king cried to go out and find the
child, that he had got loose from the dog. They
went searching for him, but they could not find
him. When they failed altogether to find him,
there remained no more favour with the king
towards me, and every one disliked me, and I
grew weak, for I did not get a morsel to eat half
the time. When summer came, I said I would
try and go home to my own country. I went
away one fine morning, and I went swimming, and
God helped me till I came home. I went into
the garden, for I knew there was a place in the
garden where I could hide myself, for fear she
should see me. In the morning I saw my wife
out walking, and my child with her, held by the
hand. I pushed out to see the child, and as he
was looking about him everywhere, he saw me
and called out, “I see my shaggy papa. Oh!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
said he; “oh, my heart’s love, my shaggy papa,
come here till I see you!”</p>

<p>I was afraid the woman would see me, as she
was asking the child where he saw me, and he
said I was up in a tree; and the more the child
called me, the more I hid myself. The woman
took the child home with her, but I knew he
would be up early in the morning.</p>

<p>I went to the parlour window, and the child
was within, and he playing. When he saw me
he cried out, “Oh! my heart’s love, come here
till I see you, shaggy papa.” I broke the window
and went in, and he began to kiss me. I saw
the rod in front of the chimney, and I jumped
up at the rod and knocked it down. “Oh! my
heart’s love, no one would give me the pretty
rod.” I thought he would strike me with the
rod, but he did not. When I saw the time was
short I raised my paw, and I gave him a scratch
below the knee. “Oh! you naughty, dirty,
shaggy papa, you have hurt me so much, I’ll give
yourself a blow of the rod.” He struck me a
light blow, and as there was no one sin on him,
I came back to my own shape again. When he
saw a man standing before him he gave a cry,
and I took him up in my arms. The servants
heard the child. A maid came in to see what
was the matter with him. When she saw me she
gave a cry out of her, and she said, “Oh, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
soul to God, if the master isn’t come to life
again!”</p>

<p>Another came in, and said it was he really.
And when the mistress heard of it, she came to
see with her own eyes, for she would not believe
I was there; and when she saw me she said
she’d drown herself. And I said to her, “If you
yourself will keep the secret, no living man will
ever get the story from me until I lose my head.”</p>

<p>Many’s the man has come asking for the story,
and I never let one return; but now every one
will know it, but she is as much to blame as I.
I gave you my head on the spot, and a thousand
welcomes, and she cannot say I have been telling
anything but the truth.</p>

<p>“Oh! surely; nor are you now.”</p>

<p>When I saw I was in a man’s shape, I said I
would take the child back to his father and
mother, as I knew the grief they were in after
him. I got a ship, and took the child with me;
and when I was journeying I came to land on an
island, and I saw not a living soul on it, only a
court dark and gloomy. I went in to see was
there any one in it. There was no one but an
old hag, tall and frightful, and she asked me,
“What sort of person are you?” I heard some
one groaning in another room, and I said I was
a doctor, and I asked her what ailed the person
who was groaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh,” said she, “it is my son, whose hand has
been bitten from his wrist by a dog.”</p>

<p>I knew then it was the boy who was taking
the child from me, and I said I would cure him
if I got a good reward.</p>

<p>“I have nothing; but there are eight young
lads and three young women, as handsome as
any one ever laid eyes on, and if you cure him
I will give you them.”</p>

<p>“But tell me in what place his hand was cut
from him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was out in another country, twelve
years ago.”</p>

<p>“Show me the way, that I may see him.”</p>

<p>She brought me into a room, so that I saw
him, and his arm was swelled up to the shoulder.
He asked if I would cure him; and I said I
would cure him if he would give me the reward
his mother promised.</p>

<p>“Oh, I will give it; but cure me.”</p>

<p>“Well, bring them out to me.”</p>

<p>The hag brought them out of the room. I
said I should burn the flesh that was on his arm.
When I looked on him he was howling with
pain. I said that I would not leave him in pain
long. The thief had only one eye in his forehead.
I took a bar of iron, and put it in the fire
till it was red, and I said to the hag, “He will
be howling at first, but will fall asleep presently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and do not wake him till he has slept as much
as he wants. I will close the door when I am
going out.” I took the bar with me, and I stood
over him, and I turned it across through his eye
as far as I could. He began to bellow, and tried
to catch me, but I was out and away, having
closed the door. The hag asked me, “Why is
he bellowing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he will be quiet presently, and will sleep
for a good while, and I’ll come again to have a
look at him; but bring me out the young men
and the young women.”</p>

<p>I took them with me, and I said to her, “Tell
me where you got them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my son brought them with him, and they
are all the offspring of the one king.”</p>

<p>I was well satisfied, and I had no liking for
delay to get myself free from the hag, and I took
them on board the ship, and the child I had myself.
I thought the king might leave me the
child I nursed myself; but when I came to land,
and all those young people with me, the king
and queen were out walking. The king was very
aged, and the queen aged likewise. When I came
to converse with them, and the twelve with me,
the king and queen began to cry. I asked, “Why
are you crying?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is for good cause I am crying. As
many children as these I should have, and now I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
am withered, grey, at the end of my life, and I
have not one at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, belike you will yet have plenty.”</p>

<p>I told him all I went through, and I gave him
the child in his hand, and “These are your other
children who were stolen from you, whom I am
giving to you safe. They are gently reared.”</p>

<p>When the king heard who they were he
smothered them with kisses and drowned them
with tears, and dried them with fine cloths silken
and the hair of his own head, and so also did
their mother, and great was his welcome for me,
as it was I who found them all. And the king
said to me, “I will give you your own child, as
it is you who have earned him best; but you must
come to my court every year, and the child with
you, and I will share with you my possessions.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have enough of my own, and after my
death I will leave it to the child.”</p>

<p>I spent a time, till my visit was over, and I told
the king all the troubles I went through, only I
said nothing about my wife. And now you have
the story.</p>

<p>[<i>The remainder is from <span class="smcap">P. McGrale’s</span> Achill version.</i>]</p>

<p>And now when you go home, and the slender
red champion asks you for news of the death of
Anshgayliacht and for the sword of light, tell
him the way in which his brother was killed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
say you have the sword; and he will ask the
sword from you; and say you to him, “If I promised
to bring it to you, I did not promise to
bring it for you;” and then throw the sword into
the air and it will come back to me.</p>

<p>He went home, and he told the story of the
death of Anshgayliacht to the slender red champion,
“And here,” said he, “is the sword.” And
the slender red champion asked for the sword, and
he said, “If I promised to bring it to you, I did
not promise to bring it for you;” and he threw
it into the air and it returned to Blue Niall.</p>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">Michael Faherty</span>, Renvyle, co. Galway.</i></p>

<p>There was a man coming from a funeral,
and it chanced as he was coming along by
the churchyard he fell in with the head of a man.
“It is good and right,” said he to himself, “to
take that with me and put it in a safe place.”
He took up the head and laid it in the churchyard.
He went on along the road home, and he
met a man with the appearance of a gentleman.</p>

<p>“Where were you?” said the gentleman.</p>

<p>“I was at a funeral, and I found the head of a
man on the road.”</p>

<p>“What did you do with it?” said the gentleman.</p>

<p>“I took it with me, and left it in the churchyard.”</p>

<p>“It was well for you,” said the gentleman.</p>

<p>“Why so?” said the man.</p>

<p>“That is my head,” said he, “and if you did
anything out of the way to it, assuredly I would
be even with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“And how did you lose your head?” said
the man.</p>

<p>“I did not lose it at all, but I left it in the
place where you found it to see what you would
do with it.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are a good person” (<i>i.e.</i> a
fairy), said the man; “and, if so, it would be
better for me to be in any other place than in
your company.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid, I won’t touch you. I would
rather do you a good turn than a bad one.”</p>

<p>“I would like that,” said the man. “Come
home with me till we get our dinner.”</p>

<p>They went home together. “Get up,” said
the man to his wife, “and make our dinner ready
for us.” The woman got up and made dinner
ready for them. When they ate their dinner,
“Come,” said the man, “till we play a game
of cards.”</p>

<p>They were playing cards that evening, and he
(the gentleman) slept that night in the house;
and on the morning of the morrow they ate
their breakfast together. When two hours were
spent,—</p>

<p>“Come with me,” said the gentleman.</p>

<p>“What business have you with me?” said
the man.</p>

<p>“That you may see the place I have at home.”</p>

<p>They got up and walked together till they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
came to the churchyard. “Lift the tombstone,”
said the gentleman. He raised the tombstone
and they went in. “Go down the stairs,” said
the gentleman. They went down together till
they came to the door; and it was opened, and
they went into the kitchen. There were two
old women sitting by the fire. “Rise,” said the
gentleman to one of them, “and get dinner ready
for us.” She rose and took some small potatoes.</p>

<p>“Have you nothing for us for dinner but that
sort?” said the gentleman.</p>

<p>“I have not,” said the woman.</p>

<p>“As you have not, keep them.”</p>

<p>“Rise you,” said he to the second woman,
“and get ready dinner for us.”</p>

<p>She rose and took some meal and husks.</p>

<p>“Have you nothing for us but that sort?”</p>

<p>“I have not,” said she.</p>

<p>“As you have not, keep them.”</p>

<p>He went up the stairs and knocked at a door.
There came out a beautiful woman in a silk dress,
and it ornamented with gold from the sole of her
foot to the crown of her head. She asked him
what he wanted. He asked her if she could get
dinner for himself and the stranger. She said she
could. She laid a dinner before them fit for a
king. And when they had eaten and drunk
plenty, the gentleman asked if he knew the reason
why she was able to give them such a dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the man; “but tell me
if it is your pleasure.”</p>

<p>“When I was alive I was married three times,
and the first wife I had never gave anything to
a poor man except little potatoes; and she must
live on them herself till the day of judgment.
The second wife, whenever any one asked alms
of her, never gave anything but meal and husks;
and she will be no better off herself, nor any one
else who asks of her, till the day of judgment.
The third wife, who got the dinner for us—she
could give us everything from the first.”</p>

<p>“Why is that?” said the man.</p>

<p>“Because she never spared of anything she
had, but would give it to a poor man; and she
will have of that kind till the day of judgment.”</p>

<p>“Come with me till you see my dwelling,” said
the gentleman. There were outhouses and stables
and woods around the house; and, to speak the
truth, he was in the prettiest place ever I saw
with my eyes. “Come inside with me,” said he
to the man; and I was not long within when
there came a piper, and he told him to play, and
he was not long playing when the house was
filled with men and women. They began dancing.
When part of the night was spent, I thought I
would go and sleep. I arose and went to sleep;
and when I awoke in the morning I could see
nothing of the house or anything in the place.</p>

<h2 id="THE_STORY_OF_BIOULTACH"><i>THE STORY OF BIOULTACH,
SON OF THE HIGH KING OF ERIN.</i></h2>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">Terence Davis</span>, Renvyle, co. Galway.</i></p>

<p>There was a king in Erin long ago, and
long ago it was. He had a pair of sons,
Bioultach and Maunus. Bioultach was the elder.
His father took him from school. The son said
to him, “Will you give me no more schooling?”</p>

<p>“I will not give. I think you have enough
learning, and I am but poor.”</p>

<p>“I give you the quarters of the heaven, of the
sea, and of the land, against my body and my
soul, that a second meal I will not eat at the one
table, that a second night I will not sleep in the
one bed, till I go to seek my fortune.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my son! evil is the oath you have taken,
and it were better for you to watch over Erin.
I think it were worth your while to stay at home,
for when you go some other nation will come
and cut it off.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it is one to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>He rose exceeding bright on the morning of
the morrow. He rubbed palm to poll and palm
to forehead, to make it be seen that he was the
best in beauty and in courage. He struck down
to the sea. He struck a plank on this side and
a plank on that till he made a ship spacious and
capacious. He struck on board the ship, and
spent four nights and four days, till he landed
in Spain without permission.</p>

<p>The King of Spain was out of doors, and he
saw the ship coming in without permission. He
sent a messenger down to ask who was the
champion.</p>

<p>The messenger came back and said to the king,
“There is but one man on board, and handsomest
of all men that ever I saw is he.”</p>

<p>“Oh! give him an invitation to the court.”</p>

<p>The messenger went and gave the invitation.
Bioultach spent a day and a year at the court.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the king, “you are at my court
for a year, and I have never asked who you are.”</p>

<p>“If you asked me I would have told you.
Bioultach am I, son of the High King of Erin,
who left my father’s court and pleasant home,
since I thought little of the learning he was giving
me; and I think I will stay here no longer.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the king, “where you
will go; but I believe there is not a place in the
world better than Greece, for there is no champion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
at all, who is a good man, that it is not in Greece
he is, in company with the king.”</p>

<p>Bioultach took leave of the king, and raised his
ship with him, and stopped not till he came to
Greece. The King of Greece was on a height
(above the sea), and with him a pair of champions—his
own son, Splendour, and Splendour-of-the-Sun,
son of the King of the Castle of the Stream.</p>

<p>“Go down,” said the king to Splendour-of-the-Sun,
“and bring me word who is the champion
that has come in without permission.”</p>

<p>He went down at the command of the king,
and saluted the man in the ship. Said he, “The
king has sent me to get word who you are.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never took from my ship word to
give you, unless you get it from me by force.”</p>

<p>“I would get it if I had you here.”</p>

<p>“I will be there now, but I must secure my
ship, that neither storm nor sun may hurt her.”</p>

<p>Bioultach went out, and he and the man on
shore took hold of each other. Bioultach threw
him and tied him tightly, and he fastened the five
knots together, and threw him behind him. The
king was looking on.</p>

<p>“Go down, Splendour, son of the King of
Greece,” said he, “and bring me word who is
the champion that has tied the other man.”</p>

<p>The son of the King of Greece went down, and
he and Bioultach took hold of each other, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Bioultach threw him and tied him more tightly
than the other, and laid him along with him.
The king had nothing for it but to send a messenger
down with a branch of green yew. When
Bioultach saw the yew coming, he loosed the men,
and the messengers bade him come with them to
the palace. Bioultach went with them, and he
spent a day and a year with the King of Greece,
learning everything the king could teach him, and
the king never asked who he was or whence he
came. But at the end of a year the king asked,—</p>

<p>“It were good to me to know your name. It
was not good to me to put any telling on you;
but now I have a desire you should tell me who
you are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will tell you, and a thousand welcomes.
If you asked me at first I would have told you.
Bioultach am I, son of the High King of Erin,
who left my father’s court and pleasant home,
since I thought little of the learning he was giving
me, and I spent a year with the King of Spain
before I came here.”</p>

<p>Bioultach had a brother, who was but little
when he went away. When he grew big he
asked the king,—</p>

<p>“Dada, where went my brother?”</p>

<p>“I know not,” said the king. “I never found
out, either by praying or by paying.”</p>

<p>“Why did he go away?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because he thought little of the learning I was
giving him.”</p>

<p>“I give you the quarters of heaven, of the earth,
and of the sea, against my body and my soul, that
a second night I will not sleep in one bed, that a
second meal at the one table I will not eat, till I
go in search of him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my son, evil is the oath you have taken,
and it were better for you to stay in Erin, nor
leave it altogether without ah heir.”</p>

<p>“More to me is my brother than all Erin.”</p>

<p>When Maunus arose in the morning he took
leave of his father, and went down to the sea, and
went on board ship, and stopped not till he came
to Spain. He spent a day and a year there. The
king asked him,—</p>

<p>“Whence are you? I would like to get word
of you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will get it. Maunus am I, son
of the High King of Erin, who left the court and
pleasant home of my father a year since, yesterday,
to search for my brother, Bioultach.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the king, “Bioultach spent a day
and year with me here, and if he is alive he is
with the King of Greece.”</p>

<p>“I will wait no longer till I see him.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the king, “if you reach Greece, do
not rise in without permission, for you have no
knowledge how to handle a sword.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>When Maunus came to Greece he ran in without
permission. The King of Greece was out of
doors, and Bioultach and Splendour, son of the
King of Greece, and Splendour-of-the-Sun, son of
the King of the Castle of the Stream.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bioultach, to-day it is three years and a
day since you landed, and since then not a ship
has come in without permission, and a ship has
come in without permission to-day. Go down,
Splendour-of-the-Sun, and get me knowledge who
is the champion.”</p>

<p>“By my soul, I will not go. Three years from
to-day Bioultach tied me, and I have never been
well since then.”</p>

<p>“Go down, Splendour, and bring me word who
is the champion.”</p>

<p>“I will not go. It was not I whom you told
to go at first. If it were, I would have gone.”</p>

<p>“I believe it is I myself must go.”</p>

<p>Splendour-of-the-Sun went down, and he and
the man on board the ship saluted each other.
“Whether you are of the noble or ignoble of
the world, whence are you?”</p>

<p>“Never from my ship have I given tidings to
tell of me till they were got from me by force.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I would do that same if I had you here.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it is soon I will be there; but I must
secure my ship, that sun may not burn nor
shingle hurt her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Maunus went out, and the two champions took
hold of each other. Maunus threw the other,
and as he never wrestled with a man before, this
is what he made with him—a ball, and he threw
him behind him.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the king, “Splendour, go down
now; he is killed yonder.”</p>

<p>Splendour, son of the King of Greece, went
down, and Maunus tied him as he did the other
man; and the king cried to Bioultach, “Thy
friendship and thy fealty; let not the sway from
Greece, for I have no other but you.”</p>

<p>“If you asked me at first I would have gone.”</p>

<p>“If I had twelve sons I would send them
before you.”</p>

<p>“I will go now.”</p>

<p>Bioultach went down, and he and Maunus
saluted each other.</p>

<p>“Of the noble or ignoble of the world, whence
are you?”</p>

<p>“I never from my ship gave tidings to tell of
me, unless you take them by force.”</p>

<p>“I will take them if I can.”</p>

<p>Bioultach and Maunus caught hold of each
other, and they spent a long part of the day, and
neither of them threw the other. Said Bioultach,
“To me it is not good at all to be like this. Let
us get swords for each.”</p>

<p>“To me it is no worse, if to you it is fine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“It were good to me if you would tell me who
you are.”</p>

<p>“I will not tell you. But if you desire to fight,
you will get that.”</p>

<p>“It is not good to me to be fighting with you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will not tell you who I am.”</p>

<p>Bioultach got a sword, and Maunus another,
and they went fighting. Bioultach was wounding
him with the sword, as Maunus did not know
how to use it.</p>

<p>“It is not good to me to wound you, and it
were good to me if you would tell me who you
are. I could have killed you twice; but it is
anguish on me to kill you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never held a sword until to-day, and
if I am wounded my skill increases; and do not
spare me, as I will not spare you if I get one
chance at you.”</p>

<p>They fought for another while.</p>

<p>“Oh! it was good to me,” said Bioultach, “you
should tell me who you are, for I do not find it
in my heart to be fighting with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Maunus, “is it not great the asking
you have after my name? But do you tell me
who you are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have not hidden my name, ever. Bioultach
am I, son of the High King of Erin, who left
my father’s court and pleasant home four years
and a day since, yesterday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Maunus, “had you a brother?”</p>

<p>“I had never but one brother, and sorry I am
he is not so big as you yet.”</p>

<p>“Whether he is big or little, it is he that has
been fighting with you since morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Bioultach, “it cannot be that you
are Maunus.”</p>

<p>They embraced one another, and Bioultach
was weeping and kissing his brother. When the
King of Greece came in among the men—“Oh,
Bioultach, what ails you?”</p>

<p>“My king and my lord, I am fighting with
my brother since morning; and if I killed him,
I would do nothing but put my sword through
my heart.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bioultach, did you not know there was
not another man able to fight with you but he?”</p>

<p>“I thought he was not yet so big.”</p>

<p>That was the time Maunus loosed the men,
and they were only just alive. The king took
them all with him—Bioultach and Maunus, and
Splendour son of the King of Greece, and
Splendour-of-the-Sun. They went to the court
of the High King of Greece.</p>

<p>Bioultach rose in the morning, and he and
Maunus went into the garden, and he began to
ask Maunus how were his father and his mother
and his sister, and how was Erin. But the High
King of Greece had a daughter, and she was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a cloister in the garden. Maunus saw her going
by, as a whiz of wind would go. “Oh, Bioultach,
do you see that beautiful woman?”</p>

<p>“I do not see. She does not concern us.
Perhaps she will never come by again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bioultach, I have never seen a woman as
beautiful as she.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can see her no more. She goes
by only once in a year.”</p>

<p>“I shall not live if I don’t get another sight of
her.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am sorry I ever saw you; but if you
had an hour of her company you would ask no
more?”</p>

<p>“I would not ask.”</p>

<p>Bioultach turned a key in the door, and let in
Maunus, who spent two hours and a-half inside.</p>

<p>“Maunus, are you coming out?”</p>

<p>“Did you not promise me an hour?”</p>

<p>“I have given you two hours and a-half. Be
coming out now.”</p>

<p>“I will not come. But I must get that woman
in marriage, or I will not leave a head on you
or on the king.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wait patiently till I tell you who she is.”</p>

<p>“Make haste and ask her of the king.”</p>

<p>Bioultach went in and threw himself on his
knees before the king. “Bioultach,” said the
king, “what is it you want? It cannot be that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
it is that hard-fortuned daughter of mine that
Maunus has seen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is she; and he says that unless he gets
her in marriage he will not leave a head on yourself
or on me.”</p>

<p>“Can this be possible? But bid him to come
in that I may see him and tell him of her doings,
and if he is content I will give her to him, and
a thousand welcomes; but let him have neither
blame nor censure for me or you.”</p>

<p>Bioultach went out to Maunus.</p>

<p>“Ha, Bioultach, have you got the woman?”</p>

<p>“I have got. But rise and come to the king,
and he will tell you how she has lived.”</p>

<p>Maunus went in to the king.</p>

<p>“Ha, Maunus, have you seen that beautiful
woman?”</p>

<p>“I have seen.”</p>

<p>“You say you must get her in marriage?”</p>

<p>“I must, or I will not leave a stone in the
place of your court.”</p>

<p>“Well, sit down,” said the king, “and I will
tell you everything now.</p>

<p>“When she was growing up there came Bocaw
More, of Kri-nă-Sorracha, otherwise Shamus Elevayreh,
son of the King of Sorracha, and he saw
her. He came and asked her in marriage. I
refused him. He came again and asked her
and I refused. He came the third time and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
she would not marry him. He told her he
would be even with her. It was well till
two years were over her, and Blue Niall, son of
the King of Spain, came here and asked her in
marriage.</p>

<p>“I told him what I am telling you. He said
he was content with her. It was well till they
were married, and when they went into their
chamber, she never saw sight of him again, nor
did any one else. It was very well till a year
passed, and there came Feathery<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Clerk, son of
the King of the Western World, and asked her
in marriage. I told him what I told the other
man. He said he was content with her. When
they were married and went to sleep, there was
no getting him. She was in the bed, but there
was no husband with her. She would not tell
where he went, and we doubted that he could
have gone and she not to know where. When
I saw the two fine men were destroyed through
her, there came on me a dislike to her, and I
made her a dwelling in the garden, and put restrictions
on her not to see a man, for I did
not like that another man should be destroyed
by her. But now, if you are satisfied, and your
brother, so that there will not be blame or censure
with you for me if anything happens, I will give
her to you and welcome. Now, Bioultach, I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
make a house, and I will put bars of iron on it
from ground to roof, and I will put three iron
doors in it, and seven locks on every door. I will
put eight hundred men round it, and Splendour,
my own son, and Splendour-of-the-Sun, and yourself
at the three doors before Maunus goes in.”</p>

<p>When they were married, and were going into
the fastness, Bioultach said to the king, “I think
it is on the outside the danger will come first, and
I would not like any one to be destroyed but
myself; I will go on the outer side entirely.”</p>

<p>Maunus and his wife went in, and the men
were planted round about the house. Bioultach
went on the outside altogether. The day grew
big with lightning and thunder, and horror came
on the day. When Bioultach saw that the men
were frightened, he ran through them till he came
to the door. He gave his shoulder to the door,
and from door to door he broke till he came
inside. The woman was in bed, and Maunus
was not with her.</p>

<p>“Ha! my good girl, where is my brother
Maunus gone?”</p>

<p>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>“Tell me where he is gone, quickly.”</p>

<p>“Have sense.”</p>

<p>“Tell me at once where he is gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will never see Maunus again.”</p>

<p>“I give you the quarters of heaven, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
earth, and of the sea, against my body and my
soul, that unless you tell me this moment where
he is gone I will put my sword through your
heart.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bioultach, your friendship and your protection!
I cannot. But, if you are the good
champion they say, take a table and place it
yonder; strip yourself, and leave on you nothing
but your shirt and trousers. Stand on the table
and defend that hole above. If a bar had been
put there at first, it would have done the business.
But take with you a sword, and I will say you
are a good champion if you defend the hole, and
I will tell you where Maunus is gone.”</p>

<p>Bioultach stripped himself, and went on the
table and took a sword. When the man above
saw the woman was going to tell the story, “Ha!
my good girl,” said he, “are you going to tell
the story?”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t heed him,” said Bioultach; “but
tell the story, and be quick.”</p>

<p>“Short is the time since Maunus was here, and
now he is in the Bake-house in the east, and three
drops on him of the molten torrent, as he had
three warnings.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you thief, you wanton, do you desire to
tell the story?”</p>

<p>“My good girl,” said Bioultach, “I will defend
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“When I was growing up,” said the woman,
“he asked me in marriage. My father refused
him three times; and even if he accepted him,
I would not marry him. He said he would be
even with me. When Blue Niall married me he
took him away, and put on him one drop of the
molten torrent, as he had one warning. When,
again, I was married to Feathery Clerk, he took
him away with him, and put on him two drops,
as he had two warnings.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you slut, go on with the story no farther!”
said the big man.</p>

<p>“Do not fear,” said Bioultach,—“go on.”</p>

<p>“As Maunus got three warnings, on him there
are three drops, and each drop goes to the bone.”</p>

<p>It was at this time the king came in through
the men, and he saw Bioultach all red with blood.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bioultach,” said he, “you are killed!”</p>

<p>“I am not. I am coloured with the blood of
the giant, but on myself there is no harm.”</p>

<p>“You are a good man, Bioultach,” said the
woman; “I did not believe there was a man in
the world would fight the giant. Now you can
come down.”</p>

<p>Bioultach sat down till he told the king. “I
do not know what you will do,” said the king.
“But I will get ready a ship, and put on board
eight hundred men of the pick of my kingdom,
and the two champions along with you; and, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
my honour, it is worse to me to part with you
than with them all.”</p>

<p>The king fitted out the ship, and he put on board
the two champions and the eight hundred men,
along with Bioultach. When Bioultach went on
board the ship they raised their great sails, speckled,
spotted, red-white, to the top of the mast; and
he left not a rope unsevered, nor a helm without
* * * * * * in the place where there were seals,
whales, crawling, creeping things, little beasts of
the sea with red mouth, rising on the sole and the
palm of the oar, making fairy music and melody
for themselves, till the sea arose in strong waves,
hushed with magic, hushed with wondrous voices;
with greatness and beauty was the ship sailing,
till to haven she came and harbour on the coast
of the Land of Brightness.</p>

<p>That was the first place where the giant had his
habitation. Bioultach and the two champions
went out on the shore. “I don’t know what we
shall do,” said Bioultach; “but stay, I see a small
little boat coming under great rowing, and in it I
see but one man.”</p>

<p>When the boat came to land, there came out
of her a ragged green man, the top of whose
head was out through his old hat, the toes of
his feet through his old boots, his elbows out
through his coat, and his knees through his old
trousers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ha, Bioultach, what likeness of adventure are
you putting on yourself to-day?”</p>

<p>“Bad luck on you! isn’t it the same to you
what likeness of adventure I am putting on myself?”
said Bioultach.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is not equal. If I were as good as I
might be, I should be beside you. But to-day let
me go before you.”</p>

<p>“I will let you and welcome.”</p>

<p>“Leave the other men on board the ship, and
we will go to see the giant. I will throw him,
and we’ll see if you can tie him. But, sorry I am,
I can do nothing but throw him.”</p>

<p>Bioultach and the ragged green man went into
the house, and when the giant saw them he was
about to be away. The ragged green man caught
him and threw him. Bioultach took hold of him
and tied him tightly, and brought the five slenders
together, so that the toes of his feet gave conversation
to the holes of his ears, and no conversation
did they give him but the height of mischief and
misfortune.</p>

<p>“Take might and mastery, Bioultach; I thought
there was not a man in the world able to tie him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bioultach,” said the giant, “tightly, tightly
have you tied me; ease the fastening a little at
the knot.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bioultach,” said the ragged green man, “it
is better to sell than to buy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Bioultach,” said the giant, “do not heed
that thief, but ease the fastening on the cord.”</p>

<p>Bioultach laid his hand on the rope, to ease the
knot, and out with the giant through the window,
and out with Bioultach after him. When the
giant was high, Bioultach was low, till the night
came, and Bioultach was forced to sit down, and
he wept his fill. He saw a little light far from
him, and he made for it. When he came in (to
the house) there was a big cat in the ashes, and
she got up and smothered him with the ashes.</p>

<p>“May you be worse a year from to-day,” said
he; and he sat down. It was not long till an old
woman came down to him.</p>

<p>“Ha, Bioultach, it had been better for you to
follow the counsel of the ragged green man than
your own.”</p>

<p>“Bad luck to you! Isn’t it all the same to
you whose counsel I follow?”</p>

<p>“Oh! it is not the same to me. Not on your
own feet are you going since morning, but on the
enchantments of the giant, and he is sailing a day
and a year’s journey from you. But I have here a
little boat of lead, and I will give it to you, and in
whatever place, in the four quarters of the world,
you order it to be, there it will be in the morning.
But you will grant me a request, if you come safe;
and, if you do not come, I will forgive you.”</p>

<p>She gave him a tablecloth: “Every time you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
spread it, there will be every kind of food and
drink on it; and fold it when you are done.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will give you any request you ask, if
I come safe.”</p>

<p>There came then from a room twelve<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> hags,
the ugliest man ever saw.</p>

<p>“Oh, the death-bands on you!” said Bioultach.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bioultach,” said the hag, “on us before
this was the beauty of youth, but now the decay
of age, as on yourself it will yet be. But I hope
you will get the better of the giant.”</p>

<p>Bioultach took the little boat. “Now, Bioultach,
the sea is not far from you. Place the boat
on the water, and ask of God and the miracles
of the leaden boat that in whatever place is the
Bocaw More of the Land of Sorracha you may be
there at morning.”</p>

<p>Bioultach placed the boat on the water. “I
ask of God and the miracles of the leaden boat
that in whatever place is the Bocaw More I may
be there at morning.”</p>

<p>When the day whitened Bioultach was in front
of an island, and the haven took fire around him
and the boat began to melt. He saw the ragged
green man rising from a stone, and he rubbing his
eyes after a while of sleeping.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bioultach, you are badly off now, and I
must make a gallon to put out the flame.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“If I am here till you make a gallon, I shall be
destroyed.”</p>

<p>“I shall not be long away.”</p>

<p>It was not long till he came. He threw three
palmfuls of water on the flame and put it out.</p>

<p>“Ha, Bioultach, I hope you will not let the
giant go to-day. He has no expectation that we
will come to-day.”</p>

<p>When they went in the giant was about to be
off; but the ragged green man caught him and
threw him. Bioultach caught him and tied him
well, better than he tied him the day before.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bioultach, you have tied me more tightly
to-day than yesterday; but ease the tie a little.”</p>

<p>“It is better to sell than to buy,” said the
ragged green man.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you are the son of a king by a queen,
ease the knot. I am not asking you to set me
free.”</p>

<p>Bioultach laid his hand to ease him, and away
with the giant through the window, and away
with Bioultach after him. He was but foolish to
seek to get a hold of him. When the night fell
Bioultach spread his tablecloth, and every sort of
food and drink he wanted was upon it. He ate
a great plenty, and he took the boat up. He laid
it on the water. “I ask of God and the miracles
of my boat that in whatever place is the Bocaw
More I may be there in the morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>He was opposite an island, and the haven froze
round him. It was not long till he saw the
ragged green man coming from the side of a
stone, and he rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bioultach, are you frozen there?”</p>

<p>“And here I shall stay.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will not stay. I will go to the forge
and make an axe to break the (ice).”</p>

<p>He came back, and an axe with him. They
broke the stone of ice. Bioultach came out.
“Now, Bioultach, as we have come on two days
unknown to the giant, he will send out two ball
players, with hurls of gold and balls of silver;
you will think they are the two champions you
left behind at the Island of the Torrent. If any
limb of their limbs touches you, or the ball, you
are a grey flagstone, and over you heaps of ice
and snow, as big as if you were there for a
hundred years.”</p>

<p>When they went up, he saw the two champions
coming. It seemed to him it was Splendour
and Splendour-of-the-Sun were there. They
ran to him, and he was running to them in his
delight. The ragged green man threw them, so
that they failed. They took out the ball. A
man of them struck the ball a blow, and it was
coming straight to Bioultach. He put up his
hand to keep off the ball from his eye. He was
struck on the palm of the hand, and he fell, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
became a grey flagstone, and a holly tree growing
through him. When the ragged green man saw
that he was destroyed, he bowed down and wept
his fill; then he went back to the Island of the
Torrent.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the men to him, “is it not long
that you have been within? But where is
Bioultach?”</p>

<p>“Oh! go ye home. Bioultach is destroyed;
he is away from you, a day and a year’s voyage
before you could reach him. He is a grey flagstone,
and over him are heaps of ice and snow.”</p>

<p>“We will not go home ever. We have no
business at home, but we will be travelling till we
get as far as he is.”</p>

<p>“Do ye think that together ye could tie the
giant?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do not know.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will bring you there in the space of
an hour.”</p>

<p>He took them with him as far as Bioultach, till
they saw him and wept together.</p>

<p>“Let us go in to see the Bocaw More.”</p>

<p>When they went in he was conversing with
his wife.</p>

<p>“Oh! you have come, and your help is not
with you.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are not a better man than my
help.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The ragged green man caught him and threw
him. The two champions went to tie him, and
he failed them. He sat down.</p>

<p>“Oh, musha, the death-bands on you both!
Am I not sorry that ever I left harbour or haven
with you? If you two tied him, I would keep a
knee on him, and Bioultach would be alive to me
at the end of an hour.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think that I could tie him by myself.”</p>

<p>The ragged green man threw him, and the two
champions went and tied him tightly.</p>

<p>“Oh! ease the knot on me a little.”</p>

<p>“You thief! we will not ease.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is the good champions you are,” said
the ragged green man; “I did not think it was
possible to tie him; but you shall see yourselves
that I shall have Bioultach now.”</p>

<p>He turned to the giant and cut fine pieces of
his flesh, till he had the full of his hands, and
he ran and squeezed the flesh down on the stone,
and Bioultach arose alive again. They smothered
him with kisses and drowned him with tears, and
dried him with fine cloths silken, and with the
hair of their heads; and when Bioultach stooped
under the door, the tree that was growing on him
fell.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bioultach,” said the giant, “tightly, tightly
it is they have tied me; but do you ease the tie
a little.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, you thief!” said Bioultach, “I will not
ease; but tell me where is Maunus?”</p>

<p>“Oh! he is in the Bake-house outside there.”</p>

<p>“How shall I get him out?”</p>

<p>“I will put out the flame with a whiff.”</p>

<p>Bioultach pulled the giant out, till he quenched
the flame and Maunus came out.</p>

<p>“Where are the other two?”</p>

<p>“They are inside,” said the giant.</p>

<p>“Bring them to me,” said Bioultach.</p>

<p>They came out both.</p>

<p>“Can it be lighted when it is empty?” said
Bioultach.</p>

<p>“Oh, it can,” said the giant.</p>

<p>“Kindle it,” said Bioultach.</p>

<p>The giant put three whiffs on it, and kindled it.</p>

<p>“Well, I put yourself into it now, and three
drops on you for ever.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Bioultach,” said the ragged green man,
“I will forgive you all that ever you did for
putting the giant in. I was afraid you would not
put him. But a thousand thanks to God that we
have escaped him.”</p>

<p>Bioultach got healing water till he cured them;
and they went on their way till they came to the
Island of the Torrent, where the eight hundred
men were on board the vessel.</p>

<p>“Oh! I believe I have forgotten. I did not go
to the hag. I must go to her now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you let me with you?” said the ragged
green man.</p>

<p>“I will let you, and welcome. Let us leave
the men here!”</p>

<p>Bioultach and the ragged green man went as
far as the hag. When Bioultach went into the
house, the cat put seven barrels of ashes out of
her skin.</p>

<p>“Oh, may you be worse a year from to-day!
you are gathering all that since I went away.”</p>

<p>Thereupon he sat down, and he did not know
where the ragged green man was gone. It was not
long till there came to him a beautiful woman,
as beautiful as ever he saw, and she said,—</p>

<p>“Oh, Bioultach, thy hundred thousand welcomes!
Good be with you. A thousand thanks
to God that you accomplished the object of your
journey.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what good is it to me, when the hag
has a request to make of me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, good was the hag herself in the time
of your difficulty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know it is myself she is asking to marry
her,” said Bioultach.</p>

<p>“Oh! are you certain?” said she.</p>

<p>“Well, I would rather put the sword through
my heart than marry her, after seeing you or the
like of you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Bioultach, you have your choice. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the woman who has the request to make; and
I will release you and bestow on you the boat for
ever, marry or marry me not.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I will marry you, and a thousand welcomes.
But I don’t know where my comrade is
gone. The old clothes that were on him are like
those I see thrown yonder.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will see him, presently.”</p>

<p>There came to him eleven women, and he could
not say which of them was the most beautiful.
They sat down, and each one of them gave him
welcome. There came a gentleman, who was
the handsomest he ever saw, and took him by the
hand.</p>

<p>“A hundred thousand welcomes to you,
Bioultach! I am Keeal-an-Iaran, son of the King
of Underwaves, who was under bonds to the
Bocaw More; and my twelve sisters were hags,
as you saw; and I without power to wear any but
old clothes, as you saw. Nor could I raise a hand
against him. But when I saw you coming, I
heard there was not a man to be got as good
as you, and I said it was possible we might get
the better of him. But we would not get the
better of him for ever, only that you let him out
each time. But, the thief! that was the thing was
worst for himself. And now I will go with you
till I leave you safe at home; and my sister, if she
is your choice. And if she is not, she will forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
you, and a thousand welcomes, as we are released
from the hole in the earth where you saw us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will marry my own wife, and will take
her home.”</p>

<p>Bioultach, and Keeal-an-Iaran, and the woman
went on board the leaden boat till they came to
the Island of the Torrent, and they took the eight
hundred men and Maunus into the leaden boat.
They took Splendour, son of the King of Greece,
Splendour-of-the-Sun, son of the King of the
Castle of the Stream, Blue Niall, son of the King
of Spain, and Feathery Clerk, son of the King
of the Western World, on board the leaden
boat. The prow to sea they turned, the stern to
shore, and they hoisted the great sails, etc., till
they came to haven and harbour on the coast of
Greece.</p>

<p>The King of Greece was out walking when
he saw the hosts making for the court, and he
recognised Bioultach.</p>

<p>“Oh, my daughter,” said he, “there are three
husbands coming to you alive now; I don’t know
to which of them you will be.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do not know,” said the daughter.</p>

<p>Bioultach came, and all the champions, to the
court, and the man of welcome was before them
in the king. They passed the night, a third in
story-telling, a third in conversation, and a third
in soft sleep and deep slumber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>When Maunus arose he asked where was his wife.</p>

<p>“Oh, she is not your wife,” said Blue Niall,
“but she is my wife.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she is my wife,” said Feathery Clerk.</p>

<p>By the laws of the land she belonged to Blue
Niall.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Maunus, “I will make laws for
myself. Any man who will not go for a day and
a year into the Bake-house, and suffer three drops
of the molten torrent, he shall not get the woman.
But any man of you two who goes there, he must
get the woman and welcome.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we will not go there, as we have got ourselves
out of it.”</p>

<p>“I will go for a year,” said Maunus, “but I
must get the woman when I come back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we will bestow her on you, but you will
not go there, nor any one else that we can keep
out of it.”</p>

<p>Maunus got the wife; and they prepared a
month’s fire and a year’s embers, till he and the
daughter of the High King of Greece were married
together; and they spent a fortnight after the
month in celebrating the wedding with every sort
of sport and play. When everything was ended,
and each champion was going to his own home,
Bioultach said,—</p>

<p>“I believe it is good and right for me to go
home to see Erin, and my father and mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, you are settled now.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Keeal-an-Iaran, “I will go with
you to see you and my sister in your home.”</p>

<p>When Bioultach arose early, full of brightness,
he rubbed palm to poll and palm to forehead, to
let it be seen that he, as a lion in his valour, was
the best in spirit, in beauty, and in courage. He
went down to the sea, with his wife and her
brother. They bade farewell to the king and the
nobles of the court, and went on board the leaden
boat. And they hoisted their great sails, etc., till
to haven they came and harbour at Binn Edin Vik
Shanla, the place where the first ship ever came
to Erin.</p>

<p>They found the ford, I the stepping-stones.
They were drowned, and I came safe.</p>

<h2 id="KING_MANANAUN"><i>KING MANANAUN.</i></h2>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">P. M’Grale</span>, Achill.</i></p>

<p>There was a king in Erin, whose name
was King Mananaun. He was the king
of druidism and enchantments and devilscraft.
A daughter was born to him, whose name was
Pampogue, and she had twelve women attending
her, and twelve maids serving her. There was
another king in Erin, whose name was King
Keeluch, and to him was born a son, whose name
was Kaytuch. He took the son to the old wise
man, and asked him where he should put his son
to learn druidism and devilscraft, so that neither
man nor weapon should get victory over him.
The old wise man told him to put him with
King Mananaun; that he was the best man of
druidism to be found. “And a year from this
night” (said he) “there was a daughter born to
him, and there are twelve women attending her,
and twelve maids serving her, and his son would
have the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a third king, whose name was Londu,
son of the King of Gur, and to him a son was
born; and he also went to the wise old man to
ask him where was the best place to put his son
to learn druidism and devilscraft, and the wise old
man told him to put him with King Mananaun.</p>

<p>The three were going to school together when
Pampogue was sixteen years old, Kaytuch fifteen,
and Londu fourteen. They were coming home
from school, and they went into the smith’s
forge; and Kaytuch took a bar of iron and
twisted it in his hand, and he threw it to Londu,
and told him to straighten it. And he took a
nail and asked the other prince what he would
take to leave his hand on the anvil, and to leave
the nail on his hand, and a blow of the great
sledge-hammer to be struck on the nail; and (the
other) said he would give it, if he would allow
him a blow without defence in the first battle
between them; and Kaytuch said he would allow
it, and he drove the nail through the palm of
Londu into the anvil. And she laughed, and
went out and home to her father’s house.</p>

<p>When the smith saw what was done in the
forge he asked Londu what he would give him
to loose him. He said that he was a poor gentleman,
but that if he ever came into his heirship
he would give him the price of his service. The
smith took hammering with him, and hammered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
at the top of the nail, and he put something under
the palm and raised it up. He went to the house
of the king and said not a word; but the king
knew all.</p>

<p>In the morning the king wrote to their fathers,
and bade them come to dinner the next day; and
the two kings came and consumed the feast,
and asked was it gold or silver was wanting to
him? if it was they would give it. And he said
it was not, but that there was a dispute between
their two sons, and he would like them to settle
it. “And I know” (said he) “it is jealousy is the
cause.” The fathers said that whatever he would
do they were satisfied. “I will open the doors,
and I will put the three inside. Let one man
come out by one door, and the other man by the
other door, and whichever of them she follows,
let her be his.”</p>

<p>When the fathers were gone he put the three
into the house and opened the doors, and she
followed Kaytuch. When Londu went out he
saw Kaytuch, and asked if he remembered that
he had a blow without defence to get on him in
their first battle. Kaytuch said, in his opinion
this was no battle.</p>

<p>“No battle at all is there greater than a fight
about a woman.”</p>

<p>Kaytuch dropped his hands, and Londu drew
his sword, and cut the head off him. Londu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
asked her, “Will you take me now he is dead?”
She refused, and said she would not marry him.
She took Kaytuch and put him in a box, and
herbs of the hill about him. She went then
and fitted out a ship great and gallant, till she
raised the great sails, speckled, spotted, as long,
as high as the top of the mast; and she left not
a rope without breaking, an oar without tearing,
with the crawling, creeping creatures, the little
beasts, the great beasts of the deep sea coming
up on the handle and blade of the oar, till she let
two thirds (of the sail) go, and one third held in,
till the eels were whistling, the froth down, and
the sand above; till she overtook the red wind
of March that was before her, and the red wind
of March that was after did not overtake her;
and she was sailing nine months before she came
to land.</p>

<p>She came near land and cast anchor, and
she saw two men coming, and they carrying
a dead man with them. In the morning the
three were going, and in the evening two were
coming, carrying the dead man again, and it
was like that for three days. One of the men
went out in a currach, and asked her who she
was, or what she was seeking. “If it’s a
husband that’s wanting to you, come and you
will get one.”</p>

<p>She told him to be off, or she would sink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
himself and his old currach.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He went and told
his brothers how she spoke, and the second of
them went and she said the like to him. Said
the third man “it is like this I have ever found
you.” He went out himself and spoke to her,
and said “God save you, young maiden! Is it
harm for me to ask who you are, or how far you
are going.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you. But will you tell me? Every
evening there are two carrying a dead man, and
three go away alive in the morning.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you that, young queen, and welcome.
When my father and mother were living
my father was a king, and when he died, there
came Fawgawns and Blue-men on us, and banished
us out of two islands; and we are on the top of
the third island with them, and as many of them
as we kill are alive to fight us again in the
morning; and every day they kill one of us, and
we bring him to life again with the healing
water.”</p>

<p>“With me is a champion, the best that ever
struck blow with sword; and I promise you his
help for a day if you bring him to life.”</p>

<p>The man went in, and brought the healing
water, and rubbed it to the wound; and Kaytuch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
arose alive again; and he rubbed his eyes with
his hands and said “Great was the sleep that was
on me”; and she laughed and told him everything
from the time the young king cut his head
off. “I took you on board ship, and we were
sailing for nine months before we came here; and
I promised your help for a day to this man if he
would bring you to life; but you will not go for
a month until you grow strong.”</p>

<p>So he and she spent the night together—a third
in talking, a third in story-telling, and a third in
soft rest and deep slumber, till the whiteness of
the day came upon the morrow.</p>

<p>Then he arose and washed his hands and face
and ate his breakfast, and went out on the island
and came to the house, and asked where they gave
battle. Said they to him: “If you were a good
champion you would have searched the place, and
you would know in what place they give battle.”</p>

<p>That made him angry, and he went away
and followed the little path that led from the
house. He did not go far when he saw the
blackness of the hill with people coming towards
him. He ran through them as runs a hawk
through flocks of wild birds, or a hound through
flocks of sheep, till he made a heap of their
heads, a heap of their feet, and a heap of their
arms and clothes. They would be a prize for
him if he thought them any good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>He stretched himself among the dead to see
who else was coming. He was not long stretched
before he saw an old man and an old woman
coming, and a pot and a feather with them; and
they threw a dash on the men on this side and
that, and they (were) rising alive like midges. He
told them to make no more alive till he killed
those they had brought to life. He killed every
one of them, and the old man and the old woman;
and the old woman put him under bond to tell
the hag of the church that he had killed the Hag
of Slaughter and Slaughter himself. He went
with himself along the road till he met with a
tall, toothless, rusty hag. He asked her if she
was the hag of the church; she said it was she.
“I give you notice that I have killed the Hag of
Slaughter and Slaughter himself.” She gave him
a hundred welcomes, and she told him she had
been three years in hell to learn druidism and
devilscraft; for it was foretold her that he would
come against them that way.</p>

<p>“Go home, and I forgive you.” He said he
would not go. Said she to him, “Use your
sword.” He drew a blow of the sword at her
and struck her, and there was a dint in the sword
that spoiled it for striking, and he put it up in
the sheath.</p>

<p>“I forgive you now, and go home.” He
said he would not go. “Throw me into a hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of water.” He threw her; and she was three
quarters of an hour in the hole, and he on top
of her to keep her down. She got up as fresh
as she was before he threw her down.</p>

<p>“I forgive you, Kaytuch.”</p>

<p>“I forgive not you.”</p>

<p>“Throw me down into a pot of brimstone.”</p>

<p>He threw her; and she was three quarters of
an hour in it. She arose as fresh as she was at
first. “I forgive you now.”</p>

<p>“I forgive not you. Defend yourself now.”</p>

<p>He drew his sword on her and struck her, but
there was no good in the sword. She put her
hands over and took hold of his skin, and put
her nails into his blood, and took the full of her
fist of his flesh with her. He was about to give
up, when the bird spoke to him, to pull her head
from its roots. He leaped high, and stood on
her shoulders, and took hold of her head, and
pulled it from its roots. She put druidism on
him then. “Tell the Lamb of Luck that you
have killed the Hag of Slaughter and Slaughter
himself and the Hag of the Church.”</p>

<p>He went along the path, and he came to a great
field, and in the field was nothing but a tree, and
a big rock of stone, and the lamb. “Are you
the Lamb of Luck?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“I give you notice I have killed the Hag of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Slaughter and Slaughter himself and the Hag of
the Church.”</p>

<p>The lamb came running to him; and there
came near him nothing but the wind, and he fell
on the ground; and when he got up he went
to the tree, and he and the lamb were running
round the tree. He ran from the tree, and leaped
round the rock. It was nine perches high and
the same in breadth. The lamb leaped through
the rock, and put his head into it; and when his
head was fastened in the rock, Kaytuch came and
cut the head off with his sword. The lamb put
him under spells: “Tell the cat of Hoorebrikë<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
that you have killed the Hag of Slaughter and
Slaughter himself and the Lamb of Luck.” He
met the cat of Hoorebrikë at the edge of a glen,
and he asked, “Are you the cat of Hoorebrikë?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>He struck a blow of his sword at the cat and
split it, and when the sword went through the
cat fastened together again. He drew a second
blow at the cat, and split it from the snout to
the tip of the tail, and the cat fastened again.
When he was drawing the third blow, the cat
leaped and put the tip of her tail into his side,
and there was a barb of poison at the tip of the
tail, and it took the heart of Kaytuch out; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Kaytuch took hold of the cat, and thrust his fist
into her mouth, and took her heart and entrails
out in his hand, and the cat and Kaytuch fell
dead.</p>

<p>And one of the three men said, “Let us rise
out, and let us help that man.” Said another of
them, “Oh! it was for a day; let it be for a
day, and him do the work of the day himself;
that they would go to help him on the next day.”
They rose out and went with themselves after
him, and as they were going they found the
slaughter made, till they came and found himself
and the cat killed. They took hold of the heart
and insides that were in his fist, and put them
into his belly again. They rubbed the healing
water on him, and he was as well as he was ever
before.</p>

<p>They went with themselves, and there came a
gust of wind and stirred a wisp, and the cat ran
and struck her foot on the wisp. They said it
was the cat’s heart they put into him in place
of his own; and one of them went forward,
and drew his sword, and cut his head off again.
They took the cat’s heart out, and put his own
heart in again, and rubbed the healing water on
him, and he was as well as he was at first.</p>

<p>When they came home they had a pleasant
night—three-thirds of the night: one-third in
talking, one-third in story-telling, and a third in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
soft rest and deep slumber. Then came the three
brothers in their arms to Kaytuch, and (asked)
him to be king in their father’s place, and they
themselves would be his messengers. He said
he would not ask their property from them, but
it should remain with themselves. They asked
him to divide the property between them. He
gave the first island to the eldest, the second
island to the second, and the island they were on
to the youngest son. When Kaytuch parted from
them, they gave him everything they had as a
present. And Kaytuch and his wife, having taken
farewell, went from the island for Erin.</p>

<p>When they came to Erin, the place where they
made haven and harbour was beneath the house
of Finn McCool. Finn sent one of his men and
told him he would give him five pounds and a
suit of clothes if he brought him word who the
man was. Conan went and asked him, “Who
are you? My master sent me to see, and said
he would give me five pounds and a suit of
clothes for bringing him word who you are.”</p>

<p>Kaytuch laid hold on him and bound him, and
threw him under the molten torrent, in a place
where every drop would go from the fat to the
marrow, and from the marrow to the inmost
marrow, and left him there. When Finn saw
what he did, he sent Keeltje to him; and Keeltje
saluted him, and spoke to him politely, and asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
him to tell him, if it were his honour’s pleasure,
who he was, that he might tell Finn.</p>

<p>“Tell Finn I will be with him for dinner.”
Then he released Conan, and told him never to
bring a message again to a gentleman.</p>

<p>Then he went part of the way with his wife,
till he put her near her fathers house, and he
returned to Finn. Then they ate their dinner,
and they went out hunting. Kaytuch said he
was a stranger, and that he would take a glen
to himself. And he took a glen to himself; and
as he was killing, he threw the game on the road,
until he said it was time for him to go home.
He tied the birds together, and made a bundle
of them, until Finn and his hosts came, and he
told them to take up the burden, but they were
not able to raise the burden. He put the tip of
his boot under it, and threw it over his shoulder,
and ran home; and Keeltje ran after him, and
Kaytuch had his dinner eaten when Keeltje came,
and they were together till morning. The second
day they went hunting, and Kaytuch went this day
to the glen they had the day before, and they
had had but two birds of that glen, but he had
the same burden. And the third day the like
happened; and on the fourth day there came a
great mist on them, and they knew not where
they were going, and they went into a great
castle, and there was food on the table, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
sat down and were eating; and there came the
shadow of a woman and took away the broken
food, and laid more food on the table until they
had eaten enough. Then there was a bed for
every two, and a bed for Kaytuch and a bed
for Finn. Then the young girl herself showed
another bed, and told the kings to go down to
the young girl; but Kaytuch said he had a wife
already, but that Finn had no wife, and for him
to go down. Finn went to her, and spoke to
her; and she said that if he would give her the
amber bracelet belonging to the daughter of the
Blauheen Bloyë, in the eastern world, he could
come into the bed to her. So he went into the
bed, and was with her till morning.</p>

<p>On the morning of the morrow Kaytuch and
Finn went to dinner to the house of King
Mananaun, and there was great welcome for them,
and mighty rejoicing that Kaytuch was come back
alive to them. They prepared a great dinner for
them, and when it was ready they sat down to
eat, and Finn took his knife and fork and laid
them on the food, and said he would not eat a
bit until Pampogue granted him a request.</p>

<p>“I will grant you any request, except to let
my husband go to fight with the Blauheen
Bloyë.”</p>

<p>“Unless you grant me that, I will not eat any
food.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sooner than you should be without eating, I
will grant you even that.”</p>

<p>And when Kaytuch saw he was to go, he rose
and threw his knife and fork from his hands, and
he went with himself, and Finn followed him.
And Pampogue followed Finn, and asked of him
one favour, to bring her husband back to her,
dead or alive; and if he were alive, to hoist the
grey-green sails, and, if dead, the red.</p>

<p>Kaytuch and Finn and the Feni went to go the
land of the eastern world, to the place where was
the Blauheen Bloyë. And when they came to
harbour they secured the ship, and Kaytuch went
to the door of the Blauheen Bloyë, and
knocked at the Cora Conra (? the knocker), and
he was asked what he wanted. And he said, a
house. And they said there was a house below,
and in it were owas, and he was to go and take it.
He went into that house, and the big owas began
to laugh and the little owas began to cry; and he
asked them the cause; and the big owas said they
would have a bit off him, and the little owas said
there would not be one bit for them to get. And
every one of them got up and put a bolt on the
door, and he put bolt and latch on the door; and
he caught hold of one of the owas by the foot,
and struck another with him, and he was killing
till he killed the last man of them. And he
rose out to see if Finn and his men were coming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and they were drawing near, twelve of the Feni,
and the twelve could not throw out one man of
the dead men. He took hold of them and threw
them out.</p>

<p>Then he went to the criers of the kitchen,
and knocked at the door, and was asked what he
sought. He said he was seeking food. They
told him to go into the field and kill an ox. He
went and he saw a bull, and the bull ran at him,
and he ran away, and came into the house, and
the bull followed him in, and he ran and closed
the two doors, and he had the bull inside. He
killed him and skinned him, and went out to see
if his people were coming, and they came into the
house, but they were not able to carry a quarter of
the bull. He put the four quarters into the skin
and carried them home.</p>

<p>He went again to the criers of the kitchen,
and he was asked, “What are you seeking now?”</p>

<p>“I am seeking turf to make a fire.”</p>

<p>“There is a stack outside, and take what you
want.”</p>

<p>There was devilment in everything. He ran
and took hold of the turf stack, and put his hands
down and pulled out some of the turf, and ran as
well as he could, and the turf was running after
him to the door to smother him. Then he
knocked for the keepers of the kitchen, and asked
them for the making of a bed, and they told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to take what he wanted from the haggard; and
he went and put his back to the haggard, and
pulled out some of the straw, and the straw
ran after him to the door to smother him, but
he ran from the haggard. He went again to the
criers of the kitchen, and they asked him
what he was looking for. He said he was
looking for water.</p>

<p>“There is a well outside, and take what you
want of it.”</p>

<p>He went to the well and put his hands into the
water, and took up some of it with him, and
the water was running after him in the hope of
drowning him, but he ran from it. Then again
he knocked for the criers of the kitchen, and
they asked him, “What are you looking for
now?”</p>

<p>“Fire,” said he, “and a pot.”</p>

<p>“Go to the house of the owas, Oramach;<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> there
is fire and a pot there, and take them with you.”</p>

<p>He went into the house of the owas, Oramach,
and the owas gave a laugh, and said the boiler
was not cooking the meat for want of fire, and
he would boil it with his head. And the two
caught hold of each other in the keen, close
clutches of wrestling. If you were to go seeking
for fun from the west of the world to the freshness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of the world, it is to that pair you would
betake yourself. They made hard of the soft,
and soft of the hard, till Kaytuch gave him a
squeeze down, and put him on his knees; and
he put his head down on the fire, and kept it
there till the flesh was cooked. He took the
pot with him, and the flesh, and he himself and
Finn had enough to eat; and he told the other
people who were with him to prepare for themselves
and eat. And he asked them to give
him leave to sleep, and for them to keep watch.
Then he slept. And what woke him but their
snoring in their sleep? He rose out, and saw
hundreds of people coming, and with them tarred
wood and straw to set fire to the house. And
Kaytuch killed them all, and went into the house
and woke the others, and bade them keep better
watch. He went to sleep, and slept not long till
he woke again, and they asleep; and he rose out
and saw (people) coming the second time as they
came first; then he ran forward and killed them
again, and he did that four times during the
night. In the morning, when the day rose, he
went to the criers of the kitchen, and knocked
at the door, and they asked him what he
was wanting. He said to them, “Three hundred
men in front of me, three hundred behind
me, three hundred on each side of me, and
three hundred on each edge of my sword’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
edges.” And he had that on the spot. He ran
through them as runs a hawk through flocks of
birds, or a dog through flocks of sheep, till he
made a heap of their heads, a heap of their feet,
a heap of their arms and clothes. If they were
a good prize they were no profit. And again
he knocked for the criers of the kitchen, and
he asked for six hundred men in front, six
hundred behind, six hundred on each side, and
six hundred on each edge of his sword’s edges.
And he had them on the spot, and he did to
them as to the first. And then he asked for
nine hundred, and treated them in the same way.
And he knocked again, and Brailskë More said
he would go himself to battle, and it was three
hours before he killed the Brailskë. The Blauheen
Bloyë arose, and said it was a pity he did not go
himself to battle at first, before his men were all
killed. And Kaytuch and he went to fight on
the ground, and the battle began between them
till Kaytuch killed him.</p>

<p>And he went into the house to the daughter,
and she asked him where was he going, the man
who killed her father and his hosts?</p>

<p>“Am I not a better man for you than all of
them?”</p>

<p>“If I had known that it was to me you were
drawing, I myself would have helped you.”</p>

<p>The two went into bed, and he took from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the amber bracelet, and was going. She asked
him would he not stay with her, and he said
he would not; and he went to Finn, and they
prepared to go home.</p>

<p>When they went on board ship, he told Finn
he was to be killed that day. He said he was
two-and-twenty-years old that day. “The man
that killed me at first is to kill me again to-day.
He will come as a bird in the air, and will put
the same form on himself as mine, and I will ask
him to come up on board the vessel, and there
will be a great battle between myself and Londu.”</p>

<p>Londu came on board the vessel. His apprenticeship
was over that day, and he was cousin
to the woman whom Kaytuch had treated so, and
taken the amber bracelet from her. The two
went to battle on board the ship. They began
young like two little boys (and fought) until they
were two old men. They fought from being two
young pups until they were two old dogs; from
being two young bulls until they were two old
bulls; from being two young stallions till they
were two old stallions. Then they began a battle
in the shape of birds; and they were fighting as
two hawks, and one of them killed the other.
The one that was below struck the one that was
above, and as the first one fell dead, he killed the
other in falling on him; and it was Londu, son
of the king of Gur, that fell first. And he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
thrown out into the sea, and the other was brought
home to the wife of Kaytuch, son of the king,
Keelach. When they came to harbour they raised
the grey-green<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> sails, and when they landed Kaytuch’s
wife was there before them; and they
gave her the bird, and she said that was what
she was to get in place of her husband. She wept
bitterly, and she with the bird, and Finn and the
Feni went home and gave her no heed. Then
she saw two birds fighting in the air, and one of
them killed the other. And birds came and put
leaves of a tree on the bird that was killed; and
it was a half-hour of the clock, and (the bird)
arose alive again. And she put the leaves on her
own bird, and then there was half an hour of the
clock, and the bird arose alive to her again. And
he asked her if she had got the amber bracelet
from Finn; and she said she did not get it. Then
she and he went to her father’s house, and there
was an invitation proclaimed for nine nights and
nine days for eating and drinking in the house of
King Mananaun, with exceeding joy that Kaytuch
was come to them safe out of every battle. And
the priest came and the pair were married. And
Finn went to the woman who put the obligation
on him to bring her the amber bracelet; and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
asked her and said to her, “If I promised to bring
it <i>to</i> you, I did not promise to bring it <i>for</i> you,
and I will not give it to you.” So he gave it
to the wife of Kaytuch when he heard he was
alive again.</p>

<p>And when everything was finished I had nothing
after them but shoes of paper and stockings of
buttermilk; and I threw them to themselves,
till I came home to you to the village of Kill-da-veac
and Kill-da-woor, to the little turf bog, to
the village where I was born, to the village at the
beginning of week, till I fired the shot of a gun
frilsjke, frælsjke, kipini, qropaanax; till I killed
Londu, and the qaanăx, till I got the load of thirty
horses of marrow I took out of the body of the
king of the wrens.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">P. Minahan</span>, Malinmore, Glencolumkille,
co. Donegal.</i></p>

<p>There was a king and a queen, and they
had three sons. She died with the third.
The king married another queen. She had ill-feeling
towards the children. The king had no
rest till he would banish the children. She took
to her bed and would not live if he would not do
something or other with them. He went to an
old man who was in the town. He told him in
what way he was. The old man told him to get a
barrel made and to put the children into it. “Put
a red belt on one and a black belt on the other.”</p>

<p>He got the barrel made, and an air-hole in it,
and a weight for ballast, to keep it from rolling.
He put the children into the barrel then. He
put two swords with them. He put them out
on the sea. The barrel was going before the
wind till it came under the court and castle of
the King of Greece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The king had a herdsman; the herdsman was
herding cows. The king had one cow, and she
was troublesome minding, licking the stones that
were on the shore. There was seaweed growing
on the stones. He ran down to the cow. He
came to the stone. He saw a white spot on the
stone. He kept looking at the stone, and he saw
that it was wood was in it. He tumbled it and
cut the end out of it. He found two children
and two swords. He put his hand down into
the barrel. He took up the two children. He
never saw two that were so fair as they. He
took the two children home. He said it was
Providence sent them to him.</p>

<p>They were with him. When he would hear
anyone coming into his house, he ordered the
children out of the room. It was told the king
that the herdsman had two children (found) in a
barrel on the shore. The king was not willing
to believe it. He said he would go himself to
the herdsman. He went to him. He asked him
if he found two children. The herdsman said he
did not find. “If you have found them,” said
the king, “do not conceal them from me.”</p>

<p>He said he had found. He told the children
to come down out of the room. They came down
to the king. The king took hold of the children
with his hands. He viewed them. “Well,” said
the king, “wherever it is the children have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
from, there is royal blood in them.” The king
had no child but one little girl.</p>

<p>“Give me the children. I will give them better
care than you. I will support yourself and your
old woman as long as you are alive.”</p>

<p>He could not refuse. The king took the
children with him. He cared for them till they
grew to be young men. The king’s daughter
thought they were her brothers. The king put
learning on them. They were the two champions.
They were fowling every day that was
fine. At that time there was a great hurling
match to come off. The King of Lochlann sent
a challenge to the King of Greece for a hurling
match, kingdom to be staked against kingdom.
There was a pretty strand under the court and
castle of the King of Greece. When the day of
the hurling match came, the King of Greece
ordered the two champions to go hunting. They
went hunting. They were not long gone from
the house when they met five young men, every
one of them with a hurling stick. “I don’t know
where they can be going,” said the champion of
the red belt.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the champion of the black
belt. They saw five others coming the same way.
He said to one of them he wondered where they
were going. “I will tell you; and it is a great
wonder that you are going fowling to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why is that?” said the champion. “I
believe you have heard all about it yourself.”</p>

<p>“I have heard nothing.”</p>

<p>“The kingdom of your father is staked against
the kingdom of the King of Lochlann in a hurling
match to-day. We are going to the hurling
match on behalf of your father.”</p>

<p>They returned home. They said to the King
of Greece they would not lose his kingdom, but
would play on his behalf. They threw off their
hunting suits. They put on light suits for running.
They got two hurls. They went to the
strand. There was a great crowd on the strand.
The ball was going out. There were twenty-four
men on each side. They said their father’s
kingdom should not be lost, that they would
play on his behalf. Two were then put out,
and they were put then in their place. There
were riders keeping the strand clear. The ball
was put in the middle of the strand down in
the sand. The forty-eight men came round the
ball. The champion of the red belt got the
ball. He struck it. When it fell again he was
shaking it, and he struck it again. He sent
it to the other end. He said to the King of
Lochlann that his kingdom was lost. The King
of Lochlann said his men had not got fair play
in the hurling. “I will give you fair play,”
said the champion of the red belt; “myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and my brother to hurl against your four-and-twenty;
and this is the bargain I’ll make with
you:—Whoever it is that sends the ball to the
goal is to have a blow with his hurl on the others:
if your four-and-twenty men win the goal against
us, they have four-and-twenty blows to strike on
us. If we win the goal, we have a blow on every
one of them.”</p>

<p>The ball was put in the sand. They gathered
round it. The champion of the red belt had
the ball. He struck it. When it fell he was
shaking it again. Not one man on the strand
got a blow at it till he put it to the goal.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “did you not get fair play?”</p>

<p>“I got it; you are the best champion ever I
saw.”</p>

<p>“Put the men in a row that I may get my
blows.”</p>

<p>He put the men standing in a row. “Now,”
said he to his brother, “any man that I don’t
knock down, knock him down you.”</p>

<p>He struck the first blow. He killed. He
struck the second blow then. He killed. He
was striking and killing. There was one man at
the end outside. When he came killing, drawing
towards him, he went out of the row. He went
up on the side of a hill.</p>

<p>“Death and destruction and the death-bands on
you, champion of the red belt! It is you that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
doing the slaughter on this strand to-day. Don’t
you know what country you came out of?—that
it is out of a two-ended barrel you came in to
the court and castle of the King of Greece?”</p>

<p>“Sit down, and wait till I come to you.”</p>

<p>“I will not wait. I saw you killing many a
one. Perhaps you will kill me.”</p>

<p>“My word to you, I will not touch you till
you tell me about the barrel.”</p>

<p>“I will take your word.”</p>

<p>He went up then till he came to the place
where he was sitting. “What is it you say about
the barrel?”</p>

<p>“It is a two-ended barrel the old man found
by the sea. He took you out of the barrel; he
took you home. The king heard he had found
two children in the barrel. He did not believe
it. He went down to the old man to see if
he had found them. The old man said he had.
He brought down the youngsters. The king sat
down. He took hold of them by the hand. He
viewed them. He said they had royal blood.”</p>

<p>“‘Give me the children. I will care for them
better than you.’</p>

<p>“‘It is hard for me to give them from me.’</p>

<p>“He could not refuse the king. The king said
he would not let them have a day of want. ‘I
will support you and your old woman as long as
you are alive.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“The King of Greece is not your father,” said
the man. “He had no family but the one young
girl in the house.”</p>

<p>“I am grateful to you for all that you have
told me about the way I came here. If I live, I
will do you a service.”</p>

<p>They were troubled. They knew not whence
they had come. They went home. The King of
Greece welcomed his two sons.</p>

<p>“Put not your sonship upon us. We are only
the children of a poor man who had no means to
rear us. I will sleep no night but this night in
your house till I find out how I came hither.”</p>

<p>“Do not so,” said the king; “stay in this place.
I will give you the half of my kingdom.”</p>

<p>“I would not stay if you gave me your kingdom
all.”</p>

<p>When the king’s daughter heard he was not
her brother, she was ready to die unless he married
her. He said to her he would not marry her;
that he would wear his two legs down to his two
knees till he found out how he came. “If I find
that out, I will come to you and marry you.”</p>

<p>They were greatly troubled when they were
departing. They went till they came to the sea.
He threw his hat out. He made a ship of the
hat, a mast of his stick, a flag of his shirt. He
hoisted the sails speckled spotted, to the top of
the straight mast. He turned the prow to sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the stern to shore, and he left not a rope without
breaking, nor a cable without rending, till he was
listening to the blowing of the seals and the roaring
of the great beasts, to the screams of the sea-gulls;
till the little red-mouthed fishes were rising
on the sole and the palm of the oars; till they
steered the vessel in under court and castle of the
King of the Underwaveland.</p>

<p>They put fastening on the ship. They went
on the land. They were going with themselves.
There was no one at all coming towards them.
They were all going one way, so that there was a
great crowd where they were stopping. Said the
brother, “Perhaps you will find some one in the
crowd to tell you how we came” (<i>i.e.</i>, our origin).</p>

<p>They went on with themselves. A man met
them. They asked him what was the cause why
the people on the island were all going one way.</p>

<p>“It has happened you were not reared in the
island when you do not know the reason of the
people’s going. The King of Underwaveland
has but one daughter. She is going to be married
to-morrow to the son of the King of the Eastern
World. There is an invitation to the wedding to
all the island. There are open cellars. There is
eating and drinking to all that come.”</p>

<p>They went on till they came to the king’s house.
There was a great crowd there. They were
strangers in it. No one gave them any heed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
No one was there without an invitation except
themselves.</p>

<p>“Stand at the door behind,” said the champion
of the red belt to his brother; “I will stand at
this door.”</p>

<p>No one went in or out that they did not strike.
They were killing them. The king got word
there were two blackguards at the door who were
killing numbers of people. The king rose out.
He said he thought there was not a blackguard
at all in the crowd; that there was eating and
drinking for every one to get. The champion of
the red belt said they were not blackguards at all;
they were two strangers on the island; they would
demean themselves by coming uninvited. The
king bowed to them and gave them an invitation.
He would invite (he said) any company in which
they were.</p>

<p>He drew them into the parlour. The bride was
there getting ready for the marriage. She and her
mother began to converse. The bride said that if
she knew he had no wife, she would not marry a
man but him. The mother told the king what the
bride said. The king told the champion of the red
belt what the bride said. The champion of the red
belt said, “I have a wife. My brother is single;
and if it is her will to marry him, I am satisfied.”</p>

<p>She sent a letter to the son of the King of the
Eastern World that she had a husband she preferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to him. He sent a letter to her that he would
not give up his wife to any man, without his
fighting for her. The champion of the black belt
sent a letter to him that he would fight at midday
on the morrow, in such and such a place. When
the morrow came the champion of the black belt
washed himself for the fight. He told the
champion of the red belt to take care of the
woman till he came back. He went then. He
was going up the road. He met an old red man
sitting by the road side. He had a great harp,
and he was playing on it. He asked the champion
of the black belt to sit down while he played him
a tune. He said he had no time, that he was
going to battle; but the old man told him to
stand a little while till he played him one tune.
He stood a while; the first strain the old man
played, he fell asleep. He was sleeping there
then till the son of the King of the Eastern World
came. He jumped down from his carriage, and
cut his head off. He went riding back. The
champion of the red belt knew nothing till he
came to the hall door.</p>

<p>“My brother is killed,” said he; “short it is till
I kill you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do that,” said the bride; “leave it to
me to do.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t do it I will destroy the island.”</p>

<p>The son of the King of the Eastern World<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
came up to the hall door. She rose out. She
caught him by the hand. He said he was fatigued
after the battle. They went into the house. She
opened a cupboard; she gave him a cup of
drink. He drank her health. When he raised
the cup of drink he bent his head backwards.
She drew a sword from under her apron. She
lopped the head from him.</p>

<p>“If you had not been so quick doing it, I
would have done the same to you as to him,” said
the champion of the red belt.</p>

<p>He went then to the place where his brother
was killed. When he came to it he was troubled.
There came a lump of mist out of the head.
Some one spoke to him out of the mist:</p>

<p>“Go to the Eastern World; the children of
Kanikinn have a bottle of the water of healing
that brings the dead to life.”</p>

<p>It put great joy on him. He went then towards
the Eastern World. He could get no information
of it. He then went on three days. He could
get no information of it. Then he went on for
three days more. Every one had information to
give him then. An old man was putting bad
spirits on him.</p>

<p>“There is a yard around the court ten feet
high. It is written on the gate: “If you go in
you will never come out alive.”</p>

<p>He went up to the gate. He cleared it at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
leap. There were three sons of Kanikinn in an
alley playing ball. They spied the champion
coming in the gate. Said one of the young men,</p>

<p>“You have come in very nimbly; not so nimbly
will you go out.”</p>

<p>“He will go,” said the eldest; “any champion
who could make that leap is a gentleman. Don’t
speak an angry word till I permit.”</p>

<p>The champion of the red belt then came
forward and saluted them as politely as he could.
He told them how things were with him; that he
had come there to seek the bottle of the water of
healing that made the dead alive.</p>

<p>“Well!” said the other, “there is ill luck on
you. The king knight of the black castle took
that bottle from me seven years ago. There is
not a day he does not kill three hundred men, and
it is better for you to tarry here with me; I will
give you a third of my possessions, for I fear he
will kill you.”</p>

<p>“I am thankful to you for your kindness: since
I have come so far I will go to meet him whether
I live or die.”</p>

<p>He asked was there any short way at all to
the castle. He showed him a short way. He
said farewell. He went on till he came to the
gate, till he cleared the gate out with a leap.
He was going with himself then for a while till
he saw the black castle. He went into the yard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
He could see no one. He feared to go in.
Night was coming, and he went in, whether he
was to live or die. There was no one within,
but the house was full of feathers. He said it
was like a slaughter-house. He heard a loud
sound coming into the house. He was startled.
There was a barrel at the side of the house. He
went behind it. Then the light burst from the
door, and the king knight of the black castle
came. He hung his sword on a peg. The blood
was dripping from the tip of it. He had on a
coat of steel. He went to put off the coat. The
champion of the red belt rose from behind the
barrel. “If that is your fighting suit, do not put
it off you till you fight with me.”</p>

<p>Said the king knight of the black castle, “It is a
man without life you are. I am only after drawing
my sword out of the last man of three hundred,
but I will not fight you till morning. If it is
lodging for the night you want, you will get it.”</p>

<p>“That is what I want.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid. I will not touch you till
morning.”</p>

<p>The king knight of the black castle set to
till he lighted the fire with sticks and faggots.
He told the other to sit near the fire. The
champion of the red belt was watching the door.
He asked him was there any one there except
himself. The king knight of the black castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
said there was not; “and great joy is there on
me to have you here to-night. I have talked
with no one for seven years.”</p>

<p>The champion of the red belt said he had
heard that there was with him a bottle of the
water of healing, that made the dead alive; that
his brother was killed. Would he give him the
loan of the bottle?</p>

<p>“I have not got the bottle. That is the bottle
that makes people alive. My stepmother took it
from me seven years ago. There is not a day I
don’t kill three hundred men, and my stepmother
brings them to life again. A hag of sorceries she
turned out, to put pains on me, that they will
never be killed for me, while I live; and but that
providence puts strength in my heart, I would
not get the better of them.”</p>

<p>When they took their supper the champion of
the red belt asked him, “Have you any one at
all but yourself?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the king knight of the black castle.
Then he asked if he had been brought up on the
island. He said, “Not he; that it was a son
of the King of Erin was in it; that his mother
died when he was born; that the king married
another queen.”</p>

<p>“Were there any other (children) but yourself?”
said the champion of the red belt.</p>

<p>“There were two other brothers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are they alive?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I think not. They were put in a two-ended
barrel.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear that your father put any mark
on them?”</p>

<p>“He said he put a red belt on one, a black belt
on the other.”</p>

<p>“True it is; people meet and the hills meet
not. I am your brother; but the champion of
the black belt is dead.”</p>

<p>He stripped and showed him the belt. The
two fell into an embrace. Then they went to rest.
When the day came on the morrow the king knight
of the black castle rose. He told his brother
not to rise, as he was tired, before breakfast was
ready. Then he got up and washed himself.
They took their breakfast. The king knight of
the black castle said it was a pity he could not
stop during the day to keep him company.</p>

<p>“Stay here, you, till I go and do my sufficiency
of killing as quickly as I can.”</p>

<p>“What would you think if I went in your
place to-day?”</p>

<p>“It would be no use for you to go with only
the strength providence has given you. You
would not get the better of them.”</p>

<p>Said the champion of the red belt, “We are two
brothers. It is a poor thing for me if I can’t kill
for one day what you are killing for seven years.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The champion of the red belt took his sword.
The other was not satisfied at all to let him go.
He would not stay on his advice.</p>

<p>“Put on my suit of steel; I could not do much
without that.”</p>

<p>“I will not put it on. Unless I fight in the
suit that’s on me, I am beaten.”</p>

<p>He went till he came to the three hundred men.
He asked them if they were ready. They said
they were. When they saw the little man coming
they were laughing and mocking him. He went
straight in through them. He made heaps of
their heads and their feet, a prize of their arms
and their clothes. When he killed the three
hundred, he stood up. He said what was the
good of killing them, and they to be alive again
in the morning? Then he lay down among the
dead men to see what it was brought them to life.
There came a hag, with one leg out of her
haunch, one eye in her forehead, a bottle of the
water of healing on a button that was on her
breast. There was a feather in the bottle. She
rubbed the feather on the first man she came to.
She made nine of them alive. The champion of
the red belt arose and killed the nine. Then he
and the one-legged hag struck together. They
were fighting a long time. He got angry that he
was wasting the day. He lopped the head off
her. He took the bottle that was hanging on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
breast. He hung it on the button that was on his
coat. Then said the hag, when she was falling,—</p>

<p>“I lay on thee the spells of the art of the druid,
to be feeble in strength as a woman in travail, in
the place of the camp or the battle, if you go not
to meet three hundred cats. Tell them you have
slain three hundred men and the one-legged hag.”</p>

<p>He went forward then till he came to the three
hundred cats. He cried out to them that he had
killed three hundred men and the one-legged hag.</p>

<p>Said they: “It is dearly you will pay for that.”</p>

<p>He and the cats went to battle. The cats
leaped above him. He made a rush at them. He
was killing them as fast as he could, till he killed
them all but the great old speckled cat. Said she
when she was falling,—</p>

<p>“I lay on thee the spells of the art of the druid,
to be feeble in strength as a woman in travail,
in the place of the camp and the battle, if you
go not to fight the Wether of Fuerish Fwee-erë.
Tell him you have slain three hundred men,
three hundred cats, and the one-legged hag.”</p>

<p>He went forward in the camp. He and the
Wether of Fuerish Fwee-erë went to battle. He
came behind him to come on him with a run to
kill him. He missed him the first time. He
went behind him again. He came at him with a
run. When the champion of the red belt saw the
Wether approaching him, he made ready not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
miss him. The Wether came forward. The
champion of the red belt put the sword through
his heart. Said he, when he was falling,—</p>

<p>“I lay on thee the spells of the art of the druid,
to be feeble in strength as a woman in travail, in
the camp and the battle, till thou goest to meet
the king cat of the Western Island. Tell him you
have slain three hundred men, and three hundred
cats, and the one-legged hag, and the Wether of
Fuerish Fwee-erë.”</p>

<p>He went forward in the camp. He met the
king cat of the Western Island.</p>

<p>“Death on you! Short is your own life now.
Little I thought I was not done with you the day
that I put you in the barrel.”</p>

<p>“Hideous hag! I am stronger to-day than I
was that day.”</p>

<p>He and the hag struck together, till he made
hard of the soft, and soft of the hard, and (made)
the fresh-water wells in the middle of the grey
stones. From the hollows of the world to the
heights of the world they came to look on at the
fight was between them.</p>

<p>She had a long tail. There was a poison spot
on the tail. There was a great claw at the tip of
the tail. She rose on high. She came down on
his head. He met her with the sword. She
curved her tail and put the claw in his hand.
He was bleeding. The day was hot and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
bleeding greatly. Down she came with a slap.
She put the poison spot through his heart. She
got the claw fixed in his heart. She drew out his
heart on his side. When the man was falling, the
cat opened her mouth as wide as she could with
the rage that was on her; and when he saw her
mouth open, and he falling, he thrust his hand
into her mouth and pulled out her heart. The
two fell dead. They were lying dead then.</p>

<p>The king knight of the black castle was troubled
that he let his brother go to fight in his place.
He went on his track to see how he was doing.
He went forward in the camp. He found the
three hundred men killed. He went forward
farther in the camp. He found the one-legged
hag killed. He went still forward in the camp.
He found the three hundred cats killed. He
went still forward in the camp. He found the
Wether of Fuerish Fwee-erë killed. He went on
and found his brother and his stepmother killed.
Then he did not know what to do. He was afraid
lest he might put the cat’s heart into the man;
for the evil temper of the cat might drive the man
mad and kill him. The lump of mist came.
It spoke to him: “Is it not easy for you to distinguish
between the big heart of the man and the
little heart of the cat?”</p>

<p>He took up the big heart. He washed it and
fixed it in his brother. He found the bottle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
water of healing that was hanging on his brother.
He dipped a feather in the bottle and rubbed it
to his brother’s mouth. His brother arose alive.</p>

<p>“I seem as if I was asleep.”</p>

<p>“Did you not wonder then? It was providence
saved me when I did not come to battle
with you on the night when you rose up from
behind the barrel, or you would have killed me
as you have done (to the others) to-day.”</p>

<p>“What good is it for you to be big when you
are not a good soldier?”</p>

<p>“It is long since I have had time any day to
kill birds. Many’s the time I was hungry when
I killed the three hundred men. I had no time
to kill birds for my breakfast in the morning.
To-day I have time to kill plenty.”</p>

<p>“You will not kill a beast to-day,” said the
champion of the red belt.</p>

<p>He then went killing. He killed. The big man
went among the gathering of the birds. He was
killing till night. He said he had enough killed.</p>

<p>Then they went home. They got ready their
supper. They took their supper. They went
to rest them. The king knight of the black
castle was not going to rise very early. He had
nothing to kill.</p>

<p>They were going to take a walk in the wood.
“Is there a woman at all who is good for much
on the island?” said the champion of the red belt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is a king’s daughter on the island, and
I think I would get her in marriage.”</p>

<p>He and his brother went to the king’s house.
He got the king’s daughter in marriage. Came
the priest of the pattens and the clerk of the bell.
The pair were married. The wedding lasted nine
nights and nine days. He took her home then.
They stayed at home a couple of days until he rested.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the champion of the red belt,
“you have a wife; it is time for me to go to
my brother to make him alive.”</p>

<p>“I will be with you,” said the king knight of
the black castle.</p>

<p>They came to his brother. He made his brother
alive as well as ever he was. They went to the
house of the King of Underwaveland. There
was great joy on the bride to see her husband.
Came the priest of the pattens and the clerk of the
bell. The pair were married.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the champion of the red belt,
“you have both your wives. It is right for you
to go with me till I get my wife.”</p>

<p>They went on then to the island of the King of
Greece. When the daughter of the King of Greece
saw the champion of the red belt there was great joy
on her. They told the King of Greece what their
birth was. Came the priest of the pattens and the
clerk of the bell. The pair were married. The
wedding lasted nine nights and nine days.</p>

<h2 id="JACK"><i>JACK.</i></h2>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">P. Minahan</span>, of Malinmore, Glencolumkille,
co. Donegal.</i></p>

<p>There was a master, and he went to look for
a servant boy. He fell in with Jack. He
hired him. He took him home. On the morning
of the morrow the master was leaving home. Jack
asked him what he should do that day.</p>

<p>“Go threshing in the barn,” said the master.</p>

<p>“Shall I thresh anything but what is there?”</p>

<p>“Do not,” said the master. “If you thresh all
that’s there, thresh no more.”</p>

<p>“What’ll I go to do then?” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Don’t do a turn till night.”</p>

<p>The master went away then, and Jack went
to the barn and began threshing. The chaff
began flying about, and he slashed through the
barn, and there was not a grain of it left in
an hour by the watch. Jack cleared the barn.
He shook the straw. He cleaned up the barn.
He went into the house and sat down by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
fire. The mistress bade him bring in a basket
of turf. He said he would not. “You won’t
be there,” said the mistress, “unless you do
some work.”</p>

<p>“I won’t do one turn till night.”</p>

<p>“Musha, you won’t be there,” said the
mistress.</p>

<p>The two quarrelled. She put him out of the
house. He went out and stayed about the place
till night.</p>

<p>When Jack went out a neighbour came in.
The mistress got dinner for him. When he was
going, she went with him part of the way. They
came to an old lime-kiln. They went into it. He
kissed the mistress. Jack was watching them
always. “If I knew,” said she, “where you
would be working to-morrow, I would bring you
your dinner.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be at work ploughing at the east end of
the village. I’ll have a white horse and a black
horse.”</p>

<p>When night came, Jack went into the byre.
The master came home. He asked where the
boy was.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where he is,” said the mistress.
“He came in here and sat down by the fire. I
bade him bring in a cleeve of turf. He said he
wouldn’t. I said he shouldn’t be there if he
didn’t work. He said he wouldn’t do a turn till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
night. We had a quarrel. I haven’t set eyes on
him since then.”</p>

<p>They went to bed. They heard a noise in the
byre. “The cattle have broken loose,” said the
mistress. “They are goring one another.” The
master called to the servant-girl to go out and
look into the byre; that the cattle were broken
loose. The girl got up and went out. She was
a while outside. She couldn’t catch the cattle.
The master got up himself and went out. The
girl was in the byre before him. He kissed the
girl. They came in. The master said two of
the cattle were broken loose. Jack was in the
byre all the time watching them, and when they
went to bed he came into the house and went to
bed. He got up on the morrow morning. “I
never saw the work I’d rather do than ploughing,”
said he. “It’s time to turn the soil up. Let us
go ploughing to-day.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” said the master. They got the
breakfast ready. They took the beasts with them
to go ploughing. The two beasts were black.
“I never saw anything I disliked more than a
black beast.” Jack went in and brought out a
white sheet. He put it on one of the beasts. He
then had a black beast and a white beast. They
went ploughing the land that was nearest to them.
When the middle of the day came, Jack raised his
head, and he ploughing. He looked before him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
He saw the woman coming near them, with a
bundle in her hand. “I don’t know,” said he,
“who that woman over there is.” The master
looked.</p>

<p>“It is my wife,” said he, “coming with our
dinner.”</p>

<p>“What a right sort of woman!” said Jack.</p>

<p>When the mistress came to them she was
ashamed to go past. They sat down and went
to take their dinner. They had a good dinner.
There were a great many eggs.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity,” said the master, “the man over
there hasn’t some dinner.”</p>

<p>“Musha,” said Jack, “I’ll go and bring him
some.”</p>

<p>“Do,” said the mistress.</p>

<p>Jack got up, and said he, “I’ll take some eggs
to be eating on the way.” He took a handful of
eggs. When he was gone a little way from them
he let one of the eggs fall on the ground. He
was dropping the eggs on the road. When he got
as far as the man he sat down and began chatting.</p>

<p>Said the mistress, “He won’t come over till the
dinner’s good for nothing.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go over myself,” said the master. He
got up and he went over, but he wasn’t gone
far when he came on an egg. He stooped and
picked it up. He was gathering the eggs on
the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the man beyond gathering?” said the
other man to Jack.</p>

<p>“He’s gathering white stones to kill you for
being with his wife yesterday in the lime-kiln.”</p>

<p>“Did he hear of that?”</p>

<p>“He heard,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“I’ll stay here no longer,” said the man.</p>

<p>He got up and went running away as fast as
he could. The master began to call after him.
He wouldn’t turn back. The master kept running
after him. When Jack saw the two of them
travelling he went back to the dinner.</p>

<p>“Where is he gone to?” said the mistress.</p>

<p>“He’s after that man for his doings with you
in the lime-kiln yesterday.”</p>

<p>The master came back to his dinner. When
the mistress saw him coming she got up and took
to her heels. When the master saw that, he
asked where was she going?</p>

<p>“She’s going to drown herself,” said Jack, “for
your kissing the servant girl in the byre last
night.”</p>

<p>“Did she hear of that?” said the master. He
went running after her. “Come back,” said he,
“and I’ll never do it again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t kill me,” said she, “and I’ll never
do it again.”</p>

<p>She returned then and they took their dinner,
but it was good for nothing. They ploughed till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
night-time. Jack was a good servant-boy. He
put in his time.</p>

<p>When he left his master he went to the big
town. He went tailoring. His master had twelve
boys before he came. Jack wasn’t long with him
when he was a great hand at the sewing. His
time was nearly up. His master thought he would
keep no one but Jack. The times were hard.
He dismissed them every one but Jack. He kept
him. They were tailoring one day. The master
said to Jack it was a bad year.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said Jack. “Do you see
that field full of cattle over there?”</p>

<p>When night came Jack and his master went out.
They went to the field. Jack took one of the
bullocks. He skinned the skin off it. He cut
the flesh off the bones. He sewed the skin on the
bullock again. They went home, and two loads
of meat with them. They had enough that time.
To make a long story short, they didn’t leave a
bullock in the field but they did the same to.
When the last of the cattle was eaten, they began
with the sheep. They played the same trick on
the sheep.</p>

<p>When the king thought it was time to kill a
bullock he went to the butcher. They went to
the field. When they went to look at a bullock,
the bullock was barely able to walk. They were
all like that. The king couldn’t tell what happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
them. They went to the field where the
sheep were. They were in bad condition. There
wasn’t a sheep or a head of cattle that Jack and
the tailor hadn’t eaten the flesh off.</p>

<p>The king went home, and he didn’t know what
to do. He went to the old man who was in the
town to tell him what happened to them.</p>

<p>“There’s some neighbour of yours that’s smart.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how I can get hold of him.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said the old man. “The first fine
day that comes take some gold and silver, spread
it out, and leave it outside till the dark comes.
Whoever is playing the tricks on you will spy
it. He’ll try for it. When night comes, take in
the money and put out a barrel of pitch.”</p>

<p>The king did so. Jack looked out at the
window. He saw the king spread out the money.
“Do you see,” said he, “what the man is doing
yonder?” Jack was watching the money all day.
Night was coming on, and nobody was going near
the money. “He has forgotten it,” said Jack;
“no one will come near it till morning.”</p>

<p>When night came Jack and his master went
drawing near the money, to take home the full of
a bag with them. They went to the place where
the money was. There was a barrel of pitch
there. “Which will you do, stoop into the barrel,
or watch?” The tailor said he would stoop. He
stooped into the barrel; he stretched his two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
hands down to get a handful. The two hands
stuck in the pitch. He was caught then. He
could not stir. He called to Jack to draw him
out of the barrel. Jack went to draw him. He
failed to draw him. He placed his two hands on
his body and shoved him down on the crown of
his head. He left him there.</p>

<p>The king came in the morning. He found the
thief caught in the barrel. He couldn’t tell then
who he was, he was so black with pitch. He was
as bad as ever. He went to the old man again.
He said the thief was caught by him, but he
didn’t know who he was.</p>

<p>“Do you know what you’ll do? Take a beast
and tie him to the beast’s tail. Whoever it is that
has lost her husband, when she sees him she will
go crying.”</p>

<p>He tied a rope on the man. He put him behind
the beast. He went through the big town with
him. He did not go far till he came to the house
of the tailor. When the tailor’s wife saw him
she gave a roar of lamentation out of her. Jack
caught hold of the scissors and cut the tip of his
finger. The king came in. He said she was
caught. The tailor (<i>i.e.</i>, Jack) looked round.
“What ails you?” said Jack.</p>

<p>“It is your wife who has lost the man and is
crying there.”</p>

<p>“It was I cut my finger,” said Jack, “and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
thought I was killed, and that’s what she was crying
for. You may go off with yourself. There’s
nothing for you to get here.”</p>

<p>The king went away. He was up and he was
down. If he were to be walking till now he
wouldn’t get one to go crying. He had nothing
for it but to go home. The tailor’s wife and Jack
were married then.</p>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">P. Minahan</span>, Malinmore, Glencolumkille,
co. Donegal.</i></p>

<p>There was a rich farmer there. He was
going from home to buy cattle. The
king and the farmer met. Each of them got a
letter that there was a young son born to the
farmer, a young daughter to the king. They
were rejoiced when they heard it. They went both
into a tavern to drink a glass. They made it up
that if the children would agree to it they would
have them married. They went home then. They
were rejoiced at the children.</p>

<p>It was not long after that when the farmer died.
His wife was broken up. She had nothing but
the child. She had to sell the farm and the stock.
She was not worth a penny. She was bringing
up the child till he was fit to go to school. He
would be out on the street, and anyone who would
have anything to carry, the boy would carry it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
him. They would give him sixpence or a shilling.
He would give that to the master of the school,
till the last of it was spent. He was coming on
with his learning, till he was a good scholar. He
was on the street one day. The king was there.
The king bought a quarter of mutton. The king
looked about him. He saw the little boy opposite
watching him. He asked him would he carry it.
The boy said he would carry. The king went
with the boy. When they came to the house the
king gave him half-a-crown. The boy went home
rejoiced. He gave that to the master. He was
at school till the half-crown was spent. One day
the daughter of the king was on the street. She
bought a parcel of clothes. She looked about her.
The boy was behind her. She asked him would
he carry the parcel. He said he would carry.
The two went to the king’s house. When the
king saw the two coming in, he went laughing.
The girl gave the boy another half-crown. She
asked her father what was the reason of his laughing.
Her father said there was none. The girl
said there was no harm in it. The king said that
at one time the boy was as good as herself. He
told her everything that had passed, nor did she
pretend anything. She had an eye on the boy
from that out. She was giving him money to
keep him at school, till he was a good scholar,
till he was growing too big to be at school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“What would you think of being a pedlar?”
said she.</p>

<p>“I have no money,” said the boy.</p>

<p>She gave him five pounds. He went to buy
hardware. He met a fighting cock. He bet his
five pounds on the cock. The cock was beaten,
and his five pounds were lost on him. He went
home then. She met him at the end of a couple
of days.</p>

<p>“How did you get on?” said she.</p>

<p>“I met a fighting cock. I bet my five pounds
on the cock. The cock was beaten. I lost the
five pounds.”</p>

<p>“Well! here are five other pounds,” said the
girl. “Do no foolishness with them, till you buy
the hardware.”</p>

<p>He went then. He fell in with a race-horse.
He took a conceit on the horse. He bet the five
pounds. The beast was beaten. The five pounds
were lost. He had to go home. He was afraid to
come across the girl. He was leaving the way for
fear he should meet her. He met her one day.</p>

<p>“Well, how did you get on?” said she.</p>

<p>“I believe you will kill me,” said he. “I lost
the five pounds again.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said she, “unless there was venture in
you, you would not have lost them. If you got
five pounds more, I think you would not lose
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“I would not,” said he.</p>

<p>She gave him five pounds more. He went.
He bought the five pounds’ worth of hardware.
He came home. He went pedlaring. He was
doing well till he sold everything. He doubled
his money. He came home then. She met him.</p>

<p>“You have made your way home,” said she.</p>

<p>“I have made,” said he.</p>

<p>“How did you get on?” said she.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said he. “I have doubled my
money.”</p>

<p>“Buy ten pounds’ worth now,” said she.</p>

<p>He bought the ten pounds’ worth. He struck
to pedlaring again, till he sold the ten pounds’
worth. He came home then. She met him.</p>

<p>“You have got home,” said she.</p>

<p>“I have got,” said he.</p>

<p>“How did you succeed?” said she.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said he; “I have twenty pounds
now.”</p>

<p>“Good you are,” said she. “Buy twenty
pounds’ worth now.”</p>

<p>He was buying and selling, till his pack was
so heavy that he was tired with it. He came
home. She met him. He said he was growing
tired carrying the pack. Would she give him
leave to buy a beast to carry it? She said she
would give him leave. He went to buy a beast.
He was buying and selling then till he had a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
deal of money. He came home then. She came
to him. He asked her would she give him leave
to set up a shop in the town. He was afraid he
would be killed for his money. She said she
would give him leave. He set up a shop then
and he laid in a stock. He was selling as much
as any two in the city.</p>

<p>The king was dealing with a merchant from
London. He came to Dublin to settle with the
king. They went to settle. They could not
agree. They got a couple of clerks to settle
between them. The clerks could not settle it all.
They were three days sitting at the settling.
They failed. The king came home at night.
His daughter came to him.</p>

<p>“How are you and the London man getting
on?”</p>

<p>“They have failed to settle it,” said the king.</p>

<p>“Did you try the shopman?” said she. “They
say he has good learning.”</p>

<p>“We did not try,” said he.</p>

<p>“Try him to-morrow,” said she.</p>

<p>He went on the morning of the morrow. They
sat down to the settling again. They sent word
for the shopman. He came. He began to look
into the books. He made it up in a moment
between the king and the man from London.
The king was satisfied then. He went home.
His daughter asked him how he got on. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
king said he got on very well, that he never saw
a better scholar. The London man came to the
young man the next day, to find out how much
he would take for a year. The young man said
he could not leave his shop. The London man
said he would give him more than he would make
by his shop in a year. He made advice to go
with him. He went home. He went to find out
if she would give him leave. She said she would
give. He put his shop to auction. He sold it
out. He made ready to go with the man from
London. He went with him then. He was
sending letters to her. She was reading them.
When the year was up, he was making ready to
go home. The London man said to him to stay
another year. He made advice to stay. He
remained another year. When the year was up
he made ready to go. He filled a ship full of
every kind of goods. He bade the captain go to
Dublin in the name of Kayleh-na-Bochtjinacht.
When the captain came to Dublin there was no
one at all of that name to be found. He did not
know what to do. He had nothing for it but to
return home. He was angry. The king was in
the city. He went to tell at home that there was a
ship was come from London with a cargo of goods,
in the name of Kayleh-na-Bochtjinacht, and that
there was no one at all in the place of that name.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the king’s daughter, “the cargo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
will go to loss. Prepare a store of your own, and
empty the cargo into it. Perhaps the owner will
come to look for it.”</p>

<p>The king got men, and they unloaded the
cargo into the store. The captain was rejoiced
when he got the vessel unloaded. When two
years were up with Kayleh-na-Bochtjinacht he was
coming home. He was walking round by the foot
of the sea. A collegian met him, going the same
road. He asked Kayleh-na-Bochtjinacht where
he was going. Kayleh answered he did not know
well where he was going; that he made a herring-net,
and the first night he put it out he had not
seen it since; that he was walking round by the
foot of the sea to look if he could find it rolled
on to a stone.</p>

<p>“Where are you going yourself?”</p>

<p>“I am going to Dublin, to be married to the
daughter of the king.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will be with you a bit of the way.”</p>

<p>A rainy day came on them, and they were
greatly wet. This young man, he was all but
perished with cold.</p>

<p>“If you had your own house from the town
with you, you would not be wet.”</p>

<p>They went on till they came to a river. There
was no bridge at all on the river. Kayleh-na-Bochtjinacht
went out into the river. He went
across. The young champion went out after him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
till he was all but lost. When he got to the other
side of the river, “I was all but lost,” said he.</p>

<p>“Well, if you had your own bridge with you,
you would not be lost.”</p>

<p>They went on another while. The champion
said he was hungry. Kayleh said, “If you had
your mother with you from home, you would not
be hungry.”</p>

<p>Kayleh had a loaf with him. He drew it out
and took his dinner. They went on then till they
came to Dublin. Kayleh stopped at the end of
the town. The young champion went to the
king’s house. He was all but famished. He
went into the parlour then. They took their
dinner. They were passing fun. The young
woman was with them.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the young champion, “there was
a fine man with me to-day, he had the silliest talk
ever I heard. When I met him, I asked him how
far he was going. He said he did not well know;
that he made a herring-net; the first night he put
it out into the sea he never had a sight of it since;
that he was walking by the foot of the sea, to look
if he would fall in with it in a creek, or rolled on
a rock. We went on another while. A day of
rain came. We were wet greatly. I called out
that I was wet.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said the man, ‘if you had your house
with you, you would not be wet.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“We went on another while, till we came to a
river. There was a great flood in the river. The
man went out. He went to the other side. I
went out after him, so that I was all but lost. I
said I was all but lost. ‘If you had your bridge
with you, you would have had no fear of being
lost.’ We went on another while. I said I was
hungry. ‘Well,’ said the man, ‘if you had your
mother with you from home, you would not have
been hungry.’” The king was listening to him.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “when you called out that you
were wet, that man had a top-coat on, that didn’t
let a drop in. When you called out you were all
but lost on the river, if you had a nag you would
not have been afraid. The other man had a good
horse.”</p>

<p>“He had,” said the champion.</p>

<p>“As good as I ever saw,” said the king’s daughter.</p>

<p>“How far was he with you?”</p>

<p>“He was with me to the end of the city.”</p>

<p>She arose standing. She went out, nor did she
stop till she was in the city, in the place where
was Kayleh-na-Bochtjinacht. She took a hold of
him by the hand. She bade him welcome home.
He got up and opened a travelling bag. He gave
her a silk gown. He put it on her. He put
silk clothes entirely on her. The two went till
they came to the king’s house. The king and the
champion thought the bride was in a room inside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
There was a knock at the door. The housemaid
arose and opened it. The young couple came in.
They asked the maid if the priest was in the
king’s house. She said he was; that the champion
and the king’s daughter were to be married. “I
would like to see the king,” said Kayleh. The
maid went to the king. She told him there
was a gentleman to see the wedding. The king
arose. He opened the parlour door. Kayleh
came to him. He said he was a stranger, that
he had a woman with him to get married to; he
would be thankful to the king to get the first
chance of being married. The king said he
would give it to him and welcome. The young
couple went into the room where the priest was.
They were married. They came out and they
married. The bride came forward to the king
and the champion. She took hold of the young
champion by the shoulder. She told him to go
home to his mother—“The silly man that was with
you to-day, I am married to him now.” “You
thought you were wise,” said the king; “but it
is you were the fool, not that man.” He had
nothing for it then but to get up and go home.
The king’s daughter then told her father who
the husband was she had. There was great joy
on the king then that the lad got on so well.</p>

<p>They built a big house then in the city. When
it was ready, they put into it the goods that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in the store. The master that was in London
came into the harbour with his ship. When
Kayleh heard he was there he was rejoiced. He
went out to see him. The captain was rejoiced
to see him. Kayleh went praising his wife. “You
are a fool,” said the captain; “maybe she’s the
worst in the world.” “How much will you wager
on it? I’ll lay my shop against your ship that
you won’t find her yielding.”</p>

<p>They laid the wager. The captain was going
out then. “What proof shall I bring that I have
had my way with her.” “There is a gold ring
on her finger. Have that for me.” “Stay you
here,” said the captain, “till I come.”</p>

<p>The captain went on shore. He went to her.
She was rejoiced to see him. She said to herself
that the captain was taking liberties with her. She
went into a room. She locked the door and left
his sight. The captain did not know then what
to do. He was afraid his ship was lost. He
went to the kitchen to the maid. He drew out
a purse of money. He said he would give her
the purse if she would open the door of the room.
She covered the money. She took the lock off the
door. The captain went to the woman. He said
he would not leave the room till she drank a drop
of his whiskey. To get rid of him she drank a
drop of the whiskey. What was in it but a sleeping
drop! She fell asleep. The captain took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
ring from her finger. He went to Kayleh. When
Kayleh saw he had the ring, the shop was lost.
He went home. When the woman saw she had
lost the ring, she knew it was all over with her.
She went away. He was raging with anger. If
he got hold of her he would kill her. She went
away ashamed. The captain went to live in the
house. He was selling the goods. Kayleh went off
wandering. She went and put a man’s clothes on
her. She went to a city. She went to a tailor’s
shop. She asked the tailor if he wanted a young
man. The tailor said he would not mind taking
one. She made it up with him. She would sell
as much as three. He thought it was a man was
with him. He was with him for a year. A poor
man came to the city selling brooms. He spent
a couple of days in the city. The mob was
casting it up to that tailor that a man from his
country was selling brooms. She said there was
never a man from her country who sold brooms.
She rose out one evening. She went through the
city to try if she could find him. She met him,
and he with a load of brooms. She asked him
if that was his means of living. The poor man
said it was—that he was all that day, and few were
the brooms he sold. She asked him how much
he got for them apiece. He said he got only a
halfpenny. She put her hand in her pocket and
gave him the price of his load.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Throw them away from you. Have you any
learning at all?” said she.</p>

<p>“I have a trifle,” said the poor man.</p>

<p>“Do you think you could do as a clerk in a
shop?”</p>

<p>“I think I could do.”</p>

<p>The tailor went and bought a suit of clothes for
him. She put them on him. He and the tailor
went to the shop.</p>

<p>“Here’s a young man I have got for you,”
said she.</p>

<p>He hired the young man for a year. The
young man came to him and was serving him well.
Better was the learning that he had than the shopman’s.
The tailor was content as they were
together. They were the two comrades; nor did
he ever recognise the tailor. They were a couple
of years in the city. One day the tailor said they
were there long enough, and would go home for
a while now. He said he would never go home.
She said she would, that they would get a place as
good as to be there. They got ready and were
drawing towards Dublin. The clerk said he
would not go near the city. She said she would
go. They walked on till they came to the city.
There was no going through the street for the
clerk. He became sorrowful and troubled. They
were walking till they came to the house they used
to live in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is a good house,” said the tailor; “we’ll
go in to see if they will keep us for the night.”</p>

<p>“We will not go into that house on any
account.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go to no other place but that,” said the
tailor.</p>

<p>They went in and got place till morning. The
captain was living there always. There were
gentlemen dining with him. The tailor was
making fun for the girls in the kitchen. He
began dancing and singing. The clerk was sitting
under the window, with his head bent down.
When the gentlemen heard the singing and the
dancing in the kitchen, they opened the parlour
door to see the tailor playing his music. They
bade him come up to the parlour, to themselves.
He said he would like to have his companion
with him. They bade the two come. The two
went up. They got whiskey. They made the
tailor sing. He was performing a while. He
looked about him.</p>

<p>“This is a fine house you have,” said he. “I
have travelled far enough, but I never in my travellings
met with a better house than this of yours.”</p>

<p>“Simply I got this house.” He told the
gentlemen how he came into the house.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the tailor, “you bear witness to
everything you have heard. I was the woman,
that was in the house, to whom that happened.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>She opened her bosom to show it was a woman.</p>

<p>“Get up, you gillie over there.” She locked
the parlour door. Kayleh went for the police.
The police came. They arrested the captain. The
gentlemen were witnesses. The captain was put
in prison. She put off the tailor’s clothes then.
They arrested the maid and put her in prison.
They fell into their house and place again. They
were then as they were ever. The report went
out through the city that Kayleh and the king’s
daughter were in their own house again. The
king then made a dinner and invited them to it.
They were eating and drinking for three nights
and three days.</p>

<h2 id="SIMON_AND_MARGARET"><i>SIMON AND MARGARET.</i></h2>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">Michael Faherty</span>, Renvyle, co. Galway.</i></p>

<p>Long ago there was a king’s son called Simon,
and he came in a ship from the east to
Eire. In the place where he came to harbour he
met with a woman whose name was Margaret,
and she fell in love with him. And she asked
him if he would take her with him in the ship.
He said he would not take her, that he had no
business with her, “for I am married already,”
said he. But the day he was going to sea she
followed him to the ship, and such a beautiful
woman was she that he said to himself that he
would not put her out of the ship; “but before I
go farther I must get beef.” He returned back
and got the beef. He took the woman and the
beef in the ship, and he ordered the sailors to make
everything ready that they might be sailing on the
sea. They were not long from land when they
saw a great bulk making towards them, and it
seemed to them it was more like a serpent than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
anything else whatever. And it was not long till
the serpent cried out, “Throw me the Irish person
you have on board.”</p>

<p>“We have no Irish person in the ship,” said the
king’s son, “for it is foreign people we are; but
we have meat we took from Eire, and, if you wish,
we will give you that.”</p>

<p>“Give it to me,” said the serpent, “and everything
else you took from Eire.”</p>

<p>He threw out a quarter of the beef, and the
serpent went away that day, and on the morrow
morning she came again, and they threw out
another quarter, and one every day till the meat
was gone. And the next day the serpent came
again and she cried out to the king’s son, “Throw
the Irish flesh out to me.”</p>

<p>“I have no more flesh,” said the prince.</p>

<p>“If you have not flesh, you have an Irish
person,” said the serpent, “and don’t be telling
your lies to me any longer. I knew from the
beginning that you had an Irish person in the
ship, and unless you throw her out to me, and
quickly, I will eat yourself and your men.”</p>

<p>Margaret came up, and no sooner did the
serpent see her than she opened her mouth, and
put on an appearance as if she were going to
swallow the ship.</p>

<p>“I will not be guilty of the death of you all,”
said Margaret; “get me a boat, and if I go far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
safe it is better; and if I do not go, I had rather I
perished than the whole of us.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do to save you?” said Simon.</p>

<p>“You can do nothing better than put me in the
boat,” said she, “and lower me on the sea, and
leave me to the will of God.”</p>

<p>As soon as she got on the sea, no sooner did
the serpent see her than she desired to swallow
her, but before she reached as far as her, a billow
of the sea rose between them, and left herself and
the boat on dry land. She saw not a house in
sight she could go to. “Now,” said she, “I am
as unfortunate as ever I was. There is no place
at all for me to get that I know of, and this is no
place for me to be.” She arose and she began to
walk, and after a long while she saw a house a
good way from her. “I am not as unfortunate as
I thought,” said she. “Perhaps I shall get lodging
in that house to-night.” She went in, and there
was no one in it but an old woman, who was
getting her supper ready. “I am asking for
lodging till morning.”</p>

<p>“I will give you no lodging,” said the old
woman.</p>

<p>“Before I go farther, there is a boat there
below, and it is better for you to take it into your
hands.”</p>

<p>“Come in,” said the old woman, “and I will
give you lodging for the night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The old woman was always praying by night
and day. Margaret asked her, “Why are you
always saying your prayers?”</p>

<p>“I and my mother were living a long while ago
in the place they call the White Doon, and a giant
came and killed my mother, and I had to come
away for fear he would kill myself; and I am
praying every night and every day that some one
may come and kill the giant.”</p>

<p>The next morning there came a gentleman and
a beautiful woman into the house, and he gave the
old woman the full of a quart of money to say
paters for them till morning. The old woman
opened a chest and took out a handsome ring, and
tried to place it on his finger, but it would not go
on. “Perhaps it would fit you,” said she to the
lady. But her finger was too big.</p>

<p>When they went out Margaret asked the old
woman who were the man and woman. “That
is the son of a king of the Eastern World, and the
name that is on him is Stephen, and he and the
woman are going to the White Doon to fight
the giant, and I am afraid they will never come
back; for the ring did not fit either of them; and
it was told to the people that no one would kill
the giant but he whom the ring would fit.”</p>

<p>The two of them remained during the night
praying for him, for fear the giant should kill
him; and early in the morning they went out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
see what had happened to Stephen and the lady
that was with him, and they found them dead
near the White Doon.</p>

<p>“I knew,” said the old woman, “this is what
would happen to them. It is better for
us to take them with us and bury them in the
churchyard.” When they were buried, “Come
home,” said the old woman, “and we’ll know
who is the first person comes the same way
again.”</p>

<p>About a month after a man came into the
house, and no sooner was he inside the door than
Margaret recognised him.</p>

<p>“How have you been ever since, Simon?”</p>

<p>“I am very well,” said he; “it can’t be that you
are Margaret?”</p>

<p>“It is I,” said she.</p>

<p>“I thought that billow that rose after you,
when you got into the boat, drowned you.”</p>

<p>“It only left me on dry land,” said Margaret.</p>

<p>“I went to the Eastern World, and my father
said to me that he sent my brother to go and fight
with the giant, who was doing great damage to
the people near the White Doon, and that my wife
went to carry his sword.”</p>

<p>“If that was your brother and your wife,” said
Margaret, “the giant killed them.”</p>

<p>“I will go on the spot and kill the giant, if I am
able.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait till I try the ring on your finger,” said
the old woman.</p>

<p>“It is too small to go on my finger,” said he.</p>

<p>“It will go on mine,” said Margaret.</p>

<p>“It will fit you,” said the old woman.</p>

<p>Simon gave the full of a quart of money to the
old woman, that she might pray for him till he
came back. When he was about to go, Margaret
said, “Will you let me go with you?”</p>

<p>“I will not,” said Simon, “for I don’t know
that the giant won’t kill myself, and I think it too
much that one of us should be in this danger.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” said Margaret. “In the place
where you die, there am I content to die.”</p>

<p>“Come with me,” said he.</p>

<p>When they were on the way to the White Doon,
a man came before them.</p>

<p>“Do you see that house near the castle?” said
the man.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Simon.</p>

<p>“You must go into it and keep a candle lighted
till morning in it.”</p>

<p>“Where is the giant?” said Simon.</p>

<p>“He will come to fight you there,” said the
man.</p>

<p>They went in and kindled a light, and they
were not long there when Margaret said to
Simon,—</p>

<p>“Come, and let us see the giants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“I cannot,” said the king, “for the light will
go out if I leave the house.”</p>

<p>“It will not go out,” said Margaret; “I will
keep it lighted till we come back.”</p>

<p>And they went together and got into the castle,
to the giant’s house, and they saw no one there
but an old woman cooking; and it was not long
till she opened an iron chest and took out the
young giants and gave them boiled blood to eat.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Margaret, “and let us go to the
house we left.”</p>

<p>They were not long in it when the king’s son
was falling asleep.</p>

<p>Margaret said to him, “If you fall asleep, it will
not be long till the giants come and kill us.”</p>

<p>“I cannot help it,” he said. “I am falling
asleep in spite of me.”</p>

<p>He fell asleep, and it was not long till Margaret
heard a noise approaching, and the giant
cried from outside to the king’s son to come out
to him.</p>

<p>“Fum, faw, faysogue! I feel the smell of a
lying churl of an Irishman. You are too great
for one bite and too little for two, and I don’t
know whether it is better for me to send you into
the Eastern World with a breath or put you under
my feet in the puddle. Which would you rather
have—striking with knives in your ribs or fighting
on the grey stones?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Great, dirty giant, not with right or rule did
I come in, but by rule and by right to cut your
head off in spite of you, when my fine, silken
feet go up and your big, dirty feet go down.”</p>

<p>They wrestled till they brought the wells of
fresh water up through the grey stones with
fighting and breaking of bones, till the night was
all but gone. Margaret squeezed him, and the
first squeeze she put him down to his knees, the
second squeeze to his waist, and the third squeeze
to his armpits.</p>

<p>“You are the best woman I have ever met. I
will give you my court and my sword of light and
the half of my estate for my life, and spare to
slay me.”</p>

<p>“Where shall I try your sword of light?”</p>

<p>“Try it on the ugliest block in the wood.”</p>

<p>“I see no block at all that is uglier than your
own great block.”</p>

<p>She struck him at the joining of the head and
the neck, and cut the head off him.</p>

<p>In the morning when she wakened the king’s
son, “Was not that a good proof I gave of myself
last night?” said he to Margaret. “That is
the head outside, and we shall try to bring it
home.”</p>

<p>He went out, and was not able to stir it from
the ground. He went in and told Margaret he
could not take it with him, that there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
pound’s weight in the head. She went out and
took the head with her.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” said he.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I will go to the Eastern World; and come
with me till you see the place.”</p>

<p>When they got home Simon took Margaret
with him to his father the king.</p>

<p>“What has happened to your brother and your
wife?” said the king.</p>

<p>“They have both been killed by the giants.
And it is Margaret, this woman here, who has
killed them.”</p>

<p>The king gave Margaret a hundred thousand
welcomes, and she and Simon were married,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and
how they are since then I do not know.</p>

<h2 id="THE_SON_OF_THE_KING_OF_PRUSSIA"><i>THE SON OF THE KING OF PRUSSIA.</i></h2>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">P. M’Grale</span>, Achill, co. Mayo.</i></p>

<p>There were giants at that time, and every
seven years three daughters of kings were
left to them to be eaten, unless some one were
found to fight them. In this year the kings came
together, and they cast lots to see which of them
should give his children to the giants to be eaten.
And the lot fell on the High King of Erin to
give his three daughters to the giants. Then came
the son of the King of Prussia to ask the king’s
daughter in marriage, and the king said he could
not give her to him unless he would fight the
giants, and he said he would fight if he got good
feeding.</p>

<p>And the king asked him, “What sort of food
would you like best?”</p>

<p>Said he, “Marrow of deer and sinews of beeves.”
And the king said he would give him that.</p>

<p>There were servants killing for him his sufficiency
of food, and he rose out, the son of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
King of Prussia, and he went among the work-people,
and when he would strike one of them
a blow of his fist and kill him the king would
not say anything for fear of making him angry.
Then, when he came within a month of the time,
he went to the glen, and tools with him to make
a hole in the glen, and he was at home every
evening, and he dirty.</p>

<p>When it came within a week of the time, the
son of the King of Scotland spoke to his father.
Said he, “A good neighbour to you was the King
of Erin ever.”</p>

<p>“Good he was, my son, and I to him likewise.”</p>

<p>“And he never put war nor battle on you.”</p>

<p>“Nor I on him, my son.”</p>

<p>“I am making one request of you, father.”</p>

<p>“Every request you make of me I will give
you, except to go to fight in Erin.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you give me that, father?”</p>

<p>“I have fear of your getting married.”</p>

<p>“My hand and my word to you, father, that that
woman I will not wed till I come back to you.”</p>

<p>“With that request, go, and I will give you my
blessing.”</p>

<p>He went with himself, then, and he arrayed
himself in his clothes, and the stars of the son of
a king by a queen were on the breast of his coat,
and a poor man’s suit outside, till he came to the
sea, and took a great ship, till he came to Erin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and drew up his ship on the land, and put on her
fastening for a day and a year, though he might
chance to be there but an hour.</p>

<p>He went then to the house of the hen-wife, and
asked for lodging; and he got lodging for the
night; and the old woman asked him what was
the news, and he said he had no news at all unless
he would get it from her.</p>

<p>“I’d say,” said she, “that it was under a docking
you came out, when you’ve heard nothing of
the great gathering that’s to be here to-morrow.
There are three giants to come, on three days,
one after the other, and they are to get the three
daughters of the King of Erin, and the son of the
King of Prussia, is to fight for them; and, if he
kills the giants, the first person to-morrow that
brings the news the giant’s head is cut off, will get
a shovel of gold.”</p>

<p>Then the poor man and the hen-wife spent the
night pleasantly, and in the morning he got up
and washed his hands and his face, and ate his
breakfast, and went to the glen, and he sat down
in a clump of ferns, brambles, and nettles, and
there was he.</p>

<p>Then the king and his people went drawing to
the glen, and when they were near it the son of the
King of Prussia told them to go home, for fear
the giant might come and kill some of them before
he could stop him. The king and his people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
went home and left the son of the King of Prussia
and the young girl in the glen, and she sat down
on a stone chair, and the son of the King of
Prussia was coming about her, thinking to make
free with her, till he ran to his hole and left
her there.</p>

<p>Then he saw the ship coming under sail, three
lengths before she came near to land, and the giant
cast anchor, and gave a step on the land, and he
all but sank the ship after him; and the land, when
he came on it, shook so greatly that the old castles
fell, and the castles that were made last stooped;
every (old) tree was broken, and the young tree
was bent; and he left not foal with mare, nor calf
with cow, nor lamb with sheep, nor hare in a bush,
nor rabbit in hole, that didn’t go off in terror.
And he came up to the girl and put the tip of his
finger under the edge of her girdle, and threw her
over the tip of his shoulder.</p>

<p>“My mischief and misfortune! Hadn’t your
father a man, cow-boy nor sheep-boy, to-day to
fight me? Or where is the son of the King of
Prussia, who has been feeding for a year to fight
me? Don’t think it’s on feather beds I’ll put
you, nor up the stairs, when I bring you home;
but you are big for one bite and small for two,
and if I had a grain of salt I would eat you at one
bite; and small is the morsel you are between
myself and my two brothers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>He went with her, drawing to the ship to get
on board; and the son of the King of Scotland
spoke to him, and said he should not get her like
that without fighting. And the giant said that
it wasn’t worth his while to let her out of his
hands, but for him to come and prevent him
taking her with him. But the other man said
that was not right, that he should put the woman
down on the land, and fight honourably. And
then the giant asked him which he liked best,
wrestling on the red flagstones, or green knives
at the top of his ribs. He said that he liked best
wrestling on the red flagstones, in the place where
his noble white feet should be rising above the
giant’s clumsy club feet. The two champions
caught hold of each other in the grip of the close,
keen wrestling. If you were to go seeking for
sport from the west of the world to the world’s
beginning, it is to that pair you would go. They
made soft of the hard, and hard of the soft, till
they drew the springs of fresh water under the red
stones; till the son of the King of Scotland remembered
that he came there without the King
of Erin knowing, nor his daughters, that he was
come; and also that his father was not pleased
with his coming; and he gave the giant a squeeze,
and put him down to his two knees in the ground,
and the second squeeze to the waist of his trousers,
and the third squeeze to the back of his neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“A green sod over you, churl!”</p>

<p>“Stay, stay! best of champions that ever I saw.
I am but a third of the world, and my brother is
the half of the world, and the other is as strong
as the world; and if you spare me, I and my
brothers will be your helpers, and we will conquer
the world.”</p>

<p>“That’s not what I will do,” said the son of
the King of Scotland; “but I will cut the head
off you.”</p>

<p>And he caught hold of his sword and cut the
head off the giant. And the young girl all the
time was watching the young champion; and she
ran to him and kissed him, and asked him if he
would come home with her, and he said he would
not come. She took a pair of scissors and cut
away a piece of the champion’s suit that was
on him.</p>

<p>He went with himself then, and came to the
hen-wife, and told her that the giant’s head was cut
off; and she asked him if any one was before her
to the king with the news. And she ran to the
king and told him the giant’s head was cut off,
and he gave her a shovel of gold as the reward of
her trouble.</p>

<p>When the son of the King of Scotland was gone,
the son of the King of Prussia arose out of his
hole, and he took with him a book and a knife,
and he swore that unless she said it was he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
done the action, he would cut the head off her
father and every one of them. He took his sword
and he cut a piece from the giant’s head, and took
it home in proof that he killed the giant.</p>

<p>The king came and his hosts before him, and
they raised him on their shoulders and carried him
home. And there was great joy on the king and
his people that the giant was killed; and the two
other sisters were cheerful; but there was dissatisfaction
and sorrow and trouble on the third sister,
and she spoke not a word to them except to say,
“You will have it yet.”</p>

<p>The king spent the night cheerfully, till the
whiteness of the day came upon the morrow.</p>

<p>The next day the second sister went out, and
the son of the King of Scotland fought for her,
and when he would not go home with her, she cut
off a lock of his hair; but the son of the King of
Prussia said it was he killed the giant. And the
next day the third sister went out, and the son of
the King of Scotland killed the third giant. The
girl asked him would he go home with her, and
he said he would not, and she took with her one
of his shoes.</p>

<p>And when the son of the King of Prussia went
home, and the third giant killed by the son of the
King of Scotland, proclamation was made of the
marriage of the son of the King of Prussia, and
the daughter of the King of Erin. And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
they ate their supper, word was sent to the priest
of the pattens and the clerk of the table, (to come)
to marry them. And the hen-wife came and the
champion to the wedding; and they arose that
the pair might be married. The priest asked the
girl if she would marry that man, and she said she
would not. And he struck her a box with his
fist, and said, “How do you know that you are
my choice? Haven’t I my choice of the family
to get?” And the king said he had.</p>

<p>Then came the second daughter, and the priest
asked her, would she marry him? and she said
she would not. And he struck her a blow of his
fist, and he said, “How do you know that you are
my choice? Haven’t I my choice of you to get?”
And the king said he had.</p>

<p>Then came the third girl, and the priest asked
her, would she marry him? and she said she would
not. And the son of the King of Prussia gave
her a blow of his fist, and he said, “How do you
know that you are my choice? Haven’t I my
choice of you to get?” And the king said he
had.</p>

<p>Then the Scotchman got up and he gave the
son of the King of Prussia a blow with the tip of
his boot and knocked him down. And the king
offered a reward of five pounds to whoever would
tell who struck the champion. And, as there
were bad people present, he was told it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
old man down there who had struck him. He
was caught, and he was bound, and when the
daughters saw him they knew him, and they
threw themselves on their knees before their
father and begged he would grant them one
request; and he said he would, but that one of
them must marry the man.</p>

<p>“It is not for that man we are asking, but for
this one, who saved us.”</p>

<p>He put the three daughters in three rooms, and
he called the eldest, and she came to him and told
him that he was the man who saved her. She put
her hand in her pocket and she took out the piece
she cut from his champion’s suit, and it answered
to the coat. Then the king called the second
daughter, and she said likewise, and showed the
lock of hair, and her father was satisfied. He
called the third daughter, and she showed the shoe,
and she said she had no fear of him, that he it was
who saved her.</p>

<p>The Scotchman got up standing, and he bound
the son of the King of Prussia, and they were
going to put him to death. Then the daughters
asked the son of the King of Scotland if he would
marry any of them, and he said that to one of
them he was bound; but that when he knew what
the son of the King of Prussia was going to do
he came without<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> his father’s leave to Erin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
save them, “and I cannot marry a woman till I go
to my father and then I will come back to you.”</p>

<p>And the daughter said, “Marry one of us and
then go to your father, and then you can come
back.”</p>

<p>He said he could not do that, that he would go
to his father first. Said she,—</p>

<p>“If you do not marry one of us, I will put you
for a year under disesteem and bad esteem; every
one will be spitting on you and cursing you; whoever
is meanest you shall be under his curses; and
till you marry one of us, or get cause for laughter,
your mouth to be at the back of your head.”</p>

<p>And when he saw that, “If I were going this
hour to marry you, I would not marry you now.”</p>

<p>The disfigurement came on him. He turned
to the door and opened his hand, and all that
were between him and the door he killed. He
went on from place to place in hopes of getting a
cure for himself, and he left not a doctor in the
place that he was not getting the water of healing
and every sort of drugs from them.</p>

<p>He was going till a man met him who was
giving food and work to every one, and he went
to him and asked him for work. The man said
he would give it if the workmen would take him.
He had eighteen men, six of them each in different
places he had, and he went up to one set of
six and said to them, “Here is a helper I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
bringing you; I don’t think he’ll increase our
work, and I myself will give him enough to eat.”</p>

<p>They spat upon him and said they would not
have him.</p>

<p>Then they came to another six, and they would
not take him; and they came to another, and they
took him. And when the master went away,
Crooked-mouth said he was sleepy, and asked for
leave to sleep that day. And they gave him leave;
and in the night he told them not to go out to
work in the morning until he came in to his
breakfast, and when he came in to his breakfast
the work of a week was done. And those six
were walking about and not doing a turn.</p>

<p>At that time a gentleman sent an invitation to
dinner to the man (who had the workmen) and for
his men to come with him. And they went drawing
that way, and a robber met them on the road
and bound every one of them and took his money
from the master. And he told his men to bind
Crooked-mouth, and Crooked-mouth said that not
one should bind him but the robber himself.</p>

<p>“Come up to me and I’ll bind you. You won’t
be having your stories to make of me.”</p>

<p>When he went to bind him, Crooked-mouth
laid hold of him, and turned him round, and threw
him on the ground, and told him to hand out his
master’s money quickly, or he would kill him. So
he gave him the money back and loosed the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Master,” said he, “here are twelve others for
him, and I will do their work.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the master, “I will not ask one turn
of you, except one meal and one drink for ever.”</p>

<p>So he gave over to the robber the twelve other
men, who had refused to let him work with them.
And before he parted with the robber he put him
under obligations.</p>

<p>“I will not kill you,” said he, “this is O’Daly,
and I am Gerald O’Daly, and anything at all that’s
ever asked of you by the honour of O’Daly, do
that.”</p>

<p>Then they went on with themselves to the
house, and there was a feast ready for them; and
they took their meal, and while they were eating,
the twelve others he gave over to the robber came.
One of them asked the robber to let them go their
way by the honour of O’Daly, and he told them
to go and a hundred welcomes, and if it were a
greater thing (he would grant it).</p>

<p>When Crooked-mouth ate his supper, he stretched
himself under the table, and when the others ate
their supper, (the gentleman) put them out to
sleep in the barn, and when he came in he heard
snoring, and he gave the man a kick, and asked
him why he wasn’t with the others, and he said
he would not leave the house that night; and the
man of the house said that he must leave; that
no one slept in the house for a year, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
should not sleep in it that night. But the other
said he would sleep in it, and find out about
everything in the house. He took the man of the
house and put him in a basket, and put him in
the chimney to smother him; and he asked him,
“Let me down, and I will tell you.” He let him
down, but he would not tell him; and he put
him back three times one after another, and the
third time he came down he told him.</p>

<p>“I was one day standing at the gable of my
house, and I saw a ship coming under full sail into
the harbour, and a man and a woman jumped out
(on the shore) and ran; and I saw a great monster
in the sea coming the same way, and the monster
ran after them; and the man put his hand in his
pocket, and pulled out something, and flung it at
the monster; and the monster sent out such a
spout of blood that the two were drowned in it.
I took them with me and washed them, and I put
herbs of the hill on them, and I have had them for
two years, and there is not a night since that I don’t
burn a penny candle looking at their beauty.”</p>

<p>He opened a room and showed them to Crooked-mouth,
and he took the water of healing and
sprinkled some of it on them, and they arose alive
again. And his mouth came as it was at first, and
the disfigurement went from him, and he asked
his brother what it was took him that way. And
his brother said,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“When you were gone a day and a year I went
to the sea, hoping to see a ship or boat that would
give me tidings of you, or to see if I would see
a board that I would recognise; and one day I
met a pretty bird-serpent, and a stone with him,
and it was written on the stone that that was the
stone that would kill the bird; and I took the
stone and the bird home with me, and I put
the bird into a cage, and kept it there for a week,
and it became so big I had to put it into the
stable; and it went on growing bigger and bigger
till I had to make a place for it in the wood, and
to tie the brambles round it, and I had four men
killing beef and giving it food. And one day I
was walking round near it, and it made a lunge at
me to eat me, and I said it would do that at last.
I went and took a ship, and went to sea, and I was
sailing three days when my sister rose up to me,
and I did not know she was on board the ship.
We were sailing till we came to the harbour, and
the serpent was following us, and I went up on the
land, and the serpent followed; and, as God was
helping me, I had my waistcoat on that day, and
the stone was in the pocket, and I flung the stone
at her, and she spouted so much blood that I
and my sister were drowned. I don’t know what
happened to us since then.”</p>

<p>“I took you with me, and cleansed you, and
put herbs of the hill round about you, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
is not a night for two years I don’t burn a penny
candle looking on you, and I believe that it is I
should get her in marriage.”</p>

<p>The four spent the night pleasantly, telling one
another everything; and in the morning when they
arose, and the people who were at supper the
night before were gathered together, the master
did not recognise that Crooked-mouth was with
him. But when Crooked-mouth told him that it
was he was there, O’Daly bade him come with
him, but he would not. He went with his brother
and his sister and the other man to Scotland.
And when they came to his father’s court, his
father was banished by Faugauns and Blue-men;
and he and the other people who were taking
possession of his father’s court began; and he and
they spent three nights and three days killing one
another, and on the third day he had killed and
banished them all. But when he and the cat met,
the cat killed him and he killed the cat; and his
brother was going everywhere that he killed, and
at last he found him and the cat dead. And he
searched his pocket and found in it the bottle of
healing-water, and as he was drawing the cork
from the bottle, some of the water fell on the
dead man, and he arose alive again.</p>

<p>He went then with his sister and the other man
who was in the place of husband to his sister; and
they cleansed the king’s castle, and he brought his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
father and mother and their people home to the
castle, and they were well from that out. Then
he gave his sister in marriage to the man, who
found himself and her on the day when the serpent
drowned them. There came the priest of the
pattens and the clerk of the table, and the pair
were wedded.</p>

<p>He himself then went back to Erin, and married
the daughter of the King of Erin, who was to be
eaten by the giants, and the son of the King of
Prussia was to save her.</p>

<p>There was a king then, and he had but one
son. He was out hunting. He was going
past the churchyard. There were four men in the
churchyard and a corpse. There was debt on the
corpse. The king’s son went in. He asked what
was the matter. Said one of the men:</p>

<p>“The dead man is in our debt. I am not
willing to bury the body, till the two sons who
are here, promise to pay the debts.”</p>

<p>“We are not able to pay,” said one of them.</p>

<p>“I have five pounds,” said the king’s son; “I
will give them to you to bury the body.”</p>

<p>He gave the five pounds. The body was
buried. The king’s son went hunting. He went
home in the evening. In the morning of the
morrow there was snow. He went out hunting
in the snow. He killed a black raven. He stood
over it and looked at it. He said in his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
mind he would never marry a woman whose head
was not as black as the bird’s wing, and her skin
as white as the snow, and her cheeks as red as the
blood on the snow.</p>

<p>He went home. On the morning of the
morrow, when he rose, he washed himself, and
he went away to find the woman. When he was
going for a time, he met with a red-haired young
man. The young man saluted him. He asked
him where he was going. The king’s son told
him he was going to get one sight of that woman.</p>

<p>“It is better for you to hire me,” said the
young man.</p>

<p>“What wages do you be asking?”</p>

<p>“Half of all we gain, to the end of a year and
a day.”</p>

<p>The two went on with themselves till the
evening came. Said the red man:</p>

<p>“There is a man related to me living in this
wood below. Do you wait here till I go down to
him.”</p>

<p>The red man went down to the house of the
giant. The giant was sitting on a chair by the fire.</p>

<p>“Uncle, dear,” said the red man, “is it like
this you are?”</p>

<p>“Yes, kinsman mine: what is coming to me?”</p>

<p>Said the red man: “The King of the prodigious
Eastern World is coming up to kill you. Get out
of the way as quick as you can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have an iron house outside there. Lock
me into it.”</p>

<p>He locked the man in. He went to his master.
He took his master up to the house of the giant.
He got ready their supper. They went to rest.
This was the giant’s cry in the morning. “Let
them open.” The red man went to him. He
asked him what was the matter.</p>

<p>“I am ready to perish with hunger. Let me
out of this quickly.”</p>

<p>“I will not let you out,” said the red man, “till
you tell me where the dark cloak is.”</p>

<p>“That is what I will never tell any one.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you like better not to tell, you will
be there till you die.”</p>

<p>“Sooner than be here any longer, it is hanging
in such a room.”</p>

<p>“I know where it is,” said the red man. “Be
here as long as you like.”</p>

<p>When the giant heard that he would not get
out, he took a jump out between two bars of
the iron house. Two halves were made of him.
Half fell outside and half inside. The red man
went to the giant’s house. He got ready the
breakfast. He and his master breakfasted. He
took with them plenty of gold and silver, two
horses and two saddles. They went till evening
was there, and they went into another wood.</p>

<p>“I have an uncle,” said the red man, “living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
here. We shall get lodging to-night. Stay you
here, till I go up.”</p>

<p>The red men went in to the giant’s house.</p>

<p>“Uncle, dear, is it here you are resting?”</p>

<p>“Yes, kinsman, dear: what is coming on me?”</p>

<p>“The King of the prodigious East is coming to
kill you. Hide yourself as quick as you can.”</p>

<p>“I have an iron house here outside. Lock me
into it.”</p>

<p>He locked him in. He brought his master.
They made ready their supper. This was the
giant’s cry in the morning, “Let them open.”</p>

<p>“I will not open,” said the red man, “till you
tell me where are the slippery shoes.”</p>

<p>“They are under the bed.”</p>

<p>“I know myself where they are,” said the red
man. “Stop there as long as you like.”</p>

<p>When the giant saw he was not to get out, he
took a leap between two bars of the iron house.
Two halves were made of him. Half fell inside,
and half out.</p>

<p>The red man and his master went on travelling
till evening. They came to another wood. There
was a giant in the wood. The red man did to
him as to the other giants. He took from him
the sword of light, and plenty of gold and silver.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the red man to his master, “we
shall be going home. We have got enough:
go forward no farther. The woman you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
approaching,—there is not a tree in the wood
on which a man’s head is not hung, except one
tree that is waiting for your head. We’ll return
home.”</p>

<p>“I will never go home,” said the king’s son,
“till I get one sight of that woman.”</p>

<p>They went forward till they came to the king’s
house. The king made great welcome for them.
They took their dinner. They spent the night
in drinking and sport. When they were sitting
to their supper she came down from the top of
the house. Her head was as black as the bird’s
wing, her skin as white as the snow, and her
cheeks as red as the blood. She came to them,
to the place where they were eating. She threw
him a comb. Said she, “If you have not that
comb to give me to-morrow, I will cut your head
from you.”</p>

<p>He took hold of the comb. He put it down
in his pocket. When they were going to bed
the red man said, “See if you have the comb.”
He put his fingers in his pocket. He had not
the comb. His tears fell.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity I did not take your advice when
you told me to return home.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we shall get the better of her entirely,”
said the red man. He was comforting him till
he got him to bed. When he got him to bed
he put on the dark cloak. He took with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the slippery shoes and the sword of light. He
went out and stood in the back yard. She came
out. She made down to the sea. She came to
the sea. She threw a shell from her pocket.
She made a boat of it. She went into the boat.
She began rowing with two paddles, till she came
in on an island that was in the sea. There was
a great giant on the shore. “Have you got
anything for me to-night?”</p>

<p>“I have not,” said she; “but I’ll have it
to-morrow night. The son of the King of Erin
is with me to-night. I shall have him for you
to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>They went to the house. “Here is the comb
I gave him to-night: it is yours.”</p>

<p>The giant opened a chest. He left the comb
in the bottom of the chest. The red man was
standing by the chest. When the giant left the
comb in it, the red man took it and put it in
his pocket. The house was full of goats. She
went to milk the goats, till she milked one part
of milk, and one part of blood. She got the
supper ready. That was the stuff they took.
The giant drew out an iron harrow and the
skin of a white mare. They lay upon that till
morning. When the day came she arose and
went away drawing to the sea. The red man
followed her. When she came to the boat she
put it in the water. She went into it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
red man followed her on the sea. He was
dashing water on her with the sword. She did
not know what was delaying her. When they
got home the red man went to his master. He
asked him was he asleep. The king’s son said
he was not.</p>

<p>“I have saved your head to-night. Here is
the comb. Put it in your pocket.”</p>

<p>He put it in his pocket. The red man went
to bed. When breakfast was ready in the morning
the bell rang. They rose and they washed.
When they were taking their breakfast she came
down from the top of the house.</p>

<p>“Have you got the comb I gave you yesterday?”</p>

<p>He put his finger in his pocket. He threw
the comb to her. When she saw he had the
comb to get she went by with one sweep. She
broke the half of what was on the table. “I
have a third of your daughter won,” said the
son of the King of Ireland.</p>

<p>“You have,” said the king; “you are the best
champion ever came into my house.”</p>

<p>They went hunting that day. When they came
home they were making fun together till supper-time.
When they were taking their supper, the
beautiful woman came to them. She threw a
pair of scissors to him: “Unless you have them
for me to-morrow, I will have your head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>He took the scissors. He put them in his
pocket. When they were going to bed said the
red man to his master, “Look and see if you have
the scissors.”</p>

<p>“I have not,” said his master.</p>

<p>“It’s bad for you to lose them.”</p>

<p>He went lamenting. The red man was comforting
him till he got him to bed. When he
slept, the red man went out. He put on the
dark cloak and the slippery shoes, and took the
sword of light. He stood outside the door. It
was not long till she came out. She went down
to the sea. She took a shell out of her pocket.
She threw it on the sea and made a boat of it.
She went to the island. The giant was on the
shore.</p>

<p>“Have you got anything for me to-night?”</p>

<p>“I have not,” she said; “but I shall have the
son of the King of Erin to-morrow night.” They
went to the house. “Here are the scissors I gave
him to-night. They are yours.”</p>

<p>The giant opened a chest. He put the scissors
in the bottom of the chest. The red man was
standing by. When the giant put the scissors in
the chest, the red man took them and put them
in his pocket.</p>

<p>They took their supper. The giant pulled out
the harrow and the skin of the white mare. They
lay upon that till morning. In the morning she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
went to the sea. The red man followed her.
She put her boat on the water. She went into it.
The red man followed her. He dashed in water
on her with the sword. When they got home,
the red man went to his master. He asked him
was he asleep? The king’s son said he was not.</p>

<p>“I have saved your head this night. Here are
the scissors for you.”</p>

<p>In the morning, when breakfast was ready, she
came down from the top of the house. She was
wet and dripping. She asked him had he the
scissors to give her. He put his hand in his
pocket. He threw her the scissors. She gave
one sweep. She did not leave a bit of delf on
the table she did not break in her rage. The
king’s son said to the king he had two-thirds of
his daughter won.</p>

<p>“You have,” said the king; “and I hope you
will win her altogether. I am tired of her.”</p>

<p>They went hunting that day till night came.
When supper was ready, she came down with a
flight.</p>

<p>“Unless you have the last lips I shall kiss this
night, I’ll have your head.”</p>

<p>“It’s hard for me,” said the king’s son, “to
know what are the last lips you kiss.”</p>

<p>He was so troubled he did not know what to
do. The red man was comforting him till he got
him to bed. Then he went out. She came out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
She went to the island. When she got in on the
island the giant was bellowing on the shore.</p>

<p>“Have you anything for me?” said the giant.</p>

<p>“I will never give you anything more. You
let the comb go; you let the scissors go: he had
the two to give me in the morning. To-night I
put on him obligations for something he won’t
have to give me: that is, the last lips I shall kiss
this night—and those are your lips.”</p>

<p>She went to milk the goats. She mixed a part
of blood, and a part of milk. She made ready
the supper. They ate and drank enough. He
got the iron harrow and the skin of the white
mare. They lay upon that till morning. When
the day came upon the morrow she kissed him
three times.</p>

<p>“Those are the last lips I shall kiss. He won’t
have them to give me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She rose and she went. When she went out
the red man whisked the head off the giant.
He put a knot in the ear. He threw it over
his shoulder. He was on the shore as soon as
she was. She went into the boat. She was
drawing to home. He went out after her.
Much as he drenched her the nights before, twice
as much did he drench her this night. They
went home. The red man came to his master
in bed.</p>

<p>“Are you asleep, master?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am not now,” said the king’s son.</p>

<p>“Here are the last lips she kissed last night,
and, by my faith, they were ugly lips for a lady
to be kissing.”</p>

<p>He took the head and threw it under the bed.
When breakfast was ready in the morning she
came down with a flight. She asked him,—</p>

<p>“Where are the last lips that I kissed last
night?”</p>

<p>He put his hand under the bed. He took
hold of the giant’s head. He threw it over at
her feet. When she saw the giant was dead she
gave one sweep, and she left not a chair or a
table, nor anything on the table, she did not make
smash of, so great was her anger.</p>

<p>“I have your daughter all won now,” said the
king’s son.</p>

<p>“You have; and you are the best champion
that came under my roof ever.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll go hunting to-day,” said the red
man. They went hunting. The red man cut
three bundles of rods. He made three flails.
When they came home, “Now,” said he, “bring
your daughter out here.”</p>

<p>The king brought her out. “Tie her hands
and feet,” said the red man, “and leave her lying
there.” The king left her lying. The red man
gave one flail to the king, and one to his master.</p>

<p>“Strike you the first blow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The king struck the first blow. The three
were striking her for a long time. A blaze of
fire came out of her mouth. “Strike ye more.
There is more in her.”</p>

<p>They struck till another lump of fire came
out of her mouth. “Strike,” said the red man,
“there is one more in her.”</p>

<p>They struck till the third came. “Now,” said
the red man, “strike her no more. Those were
three devils that came out of her. Loose her
now; she is as quiet as any woman in the world.”</p>

<p>They loosed her and put her to bed. She was
tired after the beating.</p>

<p>The priest of the pattens and the clerk of the
bells came. The pair were married. The red
man stayed with them a year and a day. A
young son was born to them. When the day
and the year were up the red man said it was
time for him to be going.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I’ll do after you,” said
the kings son.</p>

<p>“Oh, make no delay,” said the red man; “the
hire is just.”</p>

<p>“It is just,” said the king’s son.</p>

<p>He made two halves of all he gained since he
hired him. “I will give you my child all,” said
he; “I think it a pity to go to cut him in two.”</p>

<p>“I will not take him all,” said the red man;
“I will not take but my bargain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>The king’s son took a knife and was going to
cut. “Stop your hand,” said the red man. “Do
you remember the day you were going past the
churchyard? There were four men in the
churchyard. They had a corpse, and they were
arguing about the debts that were on the corpse.
They were not willing to bury the corpse till the
debts were paid. You had five pounds. You
gave them to bury the corpse. It was I was in
the coffin that day. When I saw you starting on
your journey I went to you to save you, you
were that good yourself. I bestow on you your
child and your money. Health be with you and
blessing. You will set eyes upon me no more.”</p>

co. Donegal.</i></p>

<p>Morrocha heard that Grig would live
for ever, until he was killed without sin.
He left home to put Grig to death; and he and
his boy went one day on the hill, and there came
on them rain and mist, and they went astray till
night came; and the boy said to Morrocha, “We
shall be out this night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we shall not be,” said Morrocha. And
he went and looked through the mist. “I think
I see a turf stack: it is not possible we are near
a house?” They went on for another bit, and
Morrocha stood: “I think,” said he, “I hear the
lowing of a cow.”</p>

<p>“We are near a house,” said the boy, “and
we’ll get into the byre.”</p>

<p>Morrocha stood up, and he felt the breath of a
man, and he came to him. “Bless you,” said
Morrocha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“My blessing to you,” said the man; “for if
you did not bless me, I would have your head or
you would have mine.”</p>

<p>“The death-bands on you,” said Morrocha;
“sorry I am I came to ask shelter of you.”</p>

<p>Said Theegerje, “I have no shelter to give you.
There is not a house nearer to you than the house
of Grig, and that is seven miles away; and if you
go there don’t tell that you have seen me. I am
his servant boy, and Grig is lying on the one bed
for seven years, and if you go there tell him you
are the best doctor ever stepped.”</p>

<p>Morrocha went on then, and when he came to
Grig’s house, said Grig, “If it were not that you are
a good doctor, I would cut the head from you.”</p>

<p>“The death-bands on you,” said Morrocha;
“sorry I am I came to cure you, above and
beyond the report I heard about you at home and
abroad.”</p>

<p>“And,” said Grig, “if I had Njuclas Croanj and
my wife she would not be on your side.”</p>

<p>She was sleeping at Grig’s back in the bed, and
he told her to get up, and she did not stir, and
Grig lifted his hand and struck her on the jaw-bone
and put it out of joint, and she awoke and
she said, “What made you do that to me?”</p>

<p>“Be silent, woman; don’t you see the Irish
doctor that’s come to cure me, and to see me hale
and whole and as good as ever I was?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“Musha, it’s a poor place he’s come to.
There isn’t a wisp dry or wet that isn’t under
your side, and we haven’t a stool better than the
floor, or a chair better than a lump of clay, and
we haven’t as much fire as would cook the wing
of a butterfly.”</p>

<p>“Be silent, woman,” said Grig, “and take my
old great coat and fix it under me.”</p>

<p>She did that; and Theegerje came, and a load
of faggots with him, and he put down a good fire,
and Morrocha got food to eat, and when he
warmed himself at the fire he was weary-wet, and
he was falling asleep.</p>

<p>“The death-bands on you,” said Grig; “you’re
not like a doctor, for you’ve never asked what
kind of sickness is on me.”</p>

<p>“It is not that,” said Morrocha; “but there
are numbers of people, and their blood runs all
together when they see strangers.”</p>

<p>“I am of them,” said Grig.</p>

<p>“I was not going to feel your pulse until you
got quiet.”</p>

<p>When he became quiet Morrocha arose and felt
his pulse.</p>

<p>“And great is the pity,” said he, “that a fine
man like you should be lying in that place on one
bed, and I will cure you. If you got potatoes and
butter, and ate the full of your fist, you would not
be long sick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s true,” said Grig, “and if Njuclas
Croanj gave me that I wouldn’t be lying here.”</p>

<p>Morrocha asked if they had any food in the
house, and Njuclas Croanj said they had,—that
Theegerje was just after coming from the mill,
and that he had three pecks of oatmeal. And
Morrocha bade them give him a peck of meal, and
she gave him that. And he asked if there was
any butter in the house, and she said there was.
“Bring me down a crock of fresh butter,” said
he. And she brought that to him, and Morrocha
mixed the meal and the butter up together, and
he asked for a spoon, and he thrust the spoon into
the dish.</p>

<p>“Do you see that?” said he.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Grig.</p>

<p>“You won’t get it,” said Morrocha, “till you
tell me what was the horde of people from whom
you came.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you that,” said Grig. “I am Grig,
son of Stubborn, son of Very-evil, Shanrach, son
of Canrain, son of the Soldier, who made people
loathe him greatly.”</p>

<p>“The death-bands on you,” said Morrocha.
“Weren’t they ugly names they had?”</p>

<p>“The death-bands on you,” said Grig. “Isn’t
it you that are ugly? They were prosperous,
blessed.”</p>

<p>“I give in that they were,” said Morrocha.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
“It was ignorance made me say that. But what
sort was that one, the son of the Soldier?”</p>

<p>“This,” said Grig, “was one of the fathers who
came before me; and the snout of a pig was on
his forehead; and he had two daughters, whose
names were Maywa, the big, Molloy’s daughter,
and the other’s Sahwa, the big, daughter of Cricheen,
and they went to Cornelius (?) the tailor, and they
gathered the clippings the tailors threw away, and
they made up two lying books of them, and they
failed to make the books agree upon one story;
and they struck one another, and the father came,
and they struck their father and cut him; and he
went, and he in his blood, and the pig’s snout on
his forehead, and there is not one that saw him,
but they would flee from him in thousands. And
at last they got the two books to agree upon one
story, and when the clergy heard they had the
books, they desired to possess them, and they
would not give them. And they banished them;
and if they banished them we will not leave the
night supperless.”</p>

<p>“And now,” said Morrocha, “I will give you
supper.” And he went and gave the dish to Grig,
and he ate the peck of meal and the butter mixed
together. “Now,” said the other, “thirst will
come on you; the butter was saltish, but do not
drink a drop until I gather herbs that will help
your sickness.” He went and the boy, and Njuclas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Croanj and Theegerje with them, and they put
down a big pot full of water before they went, and
Morrocha gathered the full of a basket of hellebore
(?) and he gathered tormentil, and he went
into the house with Njuclas Croanj and Theegerje,
and he bade them put the herbs into the pot and
boil them, and when he grew thirsty to give him
some of the liquor to drink, and, if he wished, some
of the stalks to eat, “and I will gather more, and
will come in to see if he is getting better.”</p>

<p>And Grig took a great thirst, and he set to
drinking what was in the pot, and he drank it all;
and when Njuclas Croanj went in, Morrocha and
his boy went away; and when Grig drank the last
of what was in the pot, he burst as he lay on the
bed; and when Njuclas Croanj saw he was dead,
she followed Morrocha; but since the Lord was
with Morrocha, he escaped.</p>

<h2 id="THE_LITTLE_GIRL_WHO_GOT_THE"><i>THE LITTLE GIRL WHO GOT THE
BETTER OF THE GENTLEMAN.</i></h2>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">P. M’Grale</span>, Achill, co. Mayo.</i></p>

<p>There was an old man with a little girl of
seven years, and he was begging; and he
came to a gentleman, and begged of him; and the
gentleman said it would be better for him to go
and earn wages than to be as he was—begging;
and the man said he would go, and willingly, if
he got any one to pay him, and the other said he
would himself give him pay, and a house to live
in for himself, and for the little girl to come to
and wash and cook for him. He gave them the
house, and they went to live in it.</p>

<p>They were not long there when the gentleman
came to the little girl one day, and thought to
take liberties with her, but she kept herself free
from him. When he saw that, he went to his
workmen, and he spoke to her father, and said to
him that he would hang him at twelve o’clock next
day unless he told him which there was the greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
number of, rivers or banks. His intention was to
put the old man to death, that he might have his
way with the little girl. And the old man went
home sorrowful and troubled, and his daughter
asked him what ailed him, and he told her he was
to be hung at twelve o’clock next day unless he
could tell which there was the greater number of,
rivers or banks.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be sorrowful,” said his daughter,
“eat your supper, and sleep plenty, and eat your
breakfast in the morning, and when you are going
to work, I will tell you.”</p>

<p>In the morning said she to him, “Say, when he
asks you the question, that there is not a river
but has two banks.”</p>

<p>When he went to work the master came and
asked him, “Which is there the greater number
of, rivers or banks?”</p>

<p>“There is not a river,” said he, “but has two
banks.”</p>

<p>“Your question is answered; but you must tell
me to-morrow the number of the stars.”</p>

<p>And he went home in the evening sorrowful
and troubled. And his daughter asked him what
ailed him, and he told her. She bade him not to
be sorrowful, for she would tell him in the morning.
And in the morning he went to his work, and his
master came and asked him to count the number
of the stars; and he said,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will, if you put posts under them.”</p>

<p>And he could not do that, but he said,—</p>

<p>“I will hang you at twelve to-morrow, if you
don’t give me the measure of the sea in quarts.”</p>

<p>And he went home to his daughter and told
her, and in the morning, as he was going to work,
she said,—</p>

<p>“Let him stop the rivers that are going into the
sea or out of it, and you will measure it in quarts.”</p>

<p>So he gave that answer to his master, and his
master could not stop the rivers.</p>

<p>Then he asked for the little girl in marriage,
and the old man told him not to be making fun of
the little girl, she was not fit for him. He would
get a lady.</p>

<p>“I will not do that,” said he, “you must give
her to me to marry.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must see the little girl; she will know
what she will do.”</p>

<p>He went to his daughter and told her what the
gentleman said, and the little girl answered her
father, and said to him,—</p>

<p>“I will marry him, but he must give me a
writing under his hand that on the day when he
puts me away he must give me my choice of all
that’s in his house, to take away three loads with
me.”</p>

<p>And he said he would give her that, and she got
it in his handwriting and signed by the lawyer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the little girl came and lived in his house
with him until she had two children.</p>

<p>At that time there was a dispute in the village
between two men, one of whom had a horse, and
the other a mare and a foal, and the three beasts
used to be together. And the man who owned
the horse said that the foal belonged to the horse;
and the man of the mare, said no, that the foal
was his; and the man who owned the horse put
law on the man who owned the mare, and they
left it to arbitration; and the man who was
brought in to decide was the gentleman, who said
he would settle it between them. And this is the
judgment he gave, “He would put the three beasts
into an empty house, and he would open two
doors, and which ever of the two the foal followed,
she should be with that one.” And he (did so)
and opened the doors, and struck each beast, and
prodded the horse; and the horse went out first
and the foal followed him. Then the foal was
given to the man who owned the horse.</p>

<p>All was well till there came some gentlemen to
the house. They went out hunting. And when
they were a while gone the woman took a fishing-rod,
and she went fishing in the lake, and she was
catching white trout until she saw the company
coming, and she turned her back to the lake, and
she began casting her line on the dry land. When
her husband saw that, he went towards her, away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
from the other people, and he came and said it
was a great wonder she should be casting her line
on the dry ground and the lake on the other side
of her; and she said it was a great wonder that
a horse without milk should have a foal. That
made him very angry, and he said on the spot,—</p>

<p>“After your dinner get ready and go from me.”</p>

<p>“Will you give me what you promised?”</p>

<p>“I will give it.”</p>

<p>After dinner, when the gentlemen were gone,
he told her to be going, and she stood up and
took with her her own child as a load and laid it
down outside the door. She came in and took
the second child as her load and put it outside.
She came and she said, “I believe yourself are the
load that’s nearest to me.” And she threw her
arms round him and took him out as her third
load. “You are now my own,” said she, “and
you cannot part from me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am content,” said he, “and I promise
I will not part from you for ever.”</p>

<p>They lived together then, and she took her
father into the house, and he was with her until
he died. They had a long life after.</p>

<h2 id="GILLA_OF_THE_ENCHANTMENTS"><i>GILLA OF THE ENCHANTMENTS.</i></h2>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">P. M’Grale</span>, Dugort, Achill co. Mayo.</i></p>

<p>There was a king in Ireland and his wife,
and they had but one daughter, whose
name was Gilla of the Enchantments, and she had
a magic coat that her mother left her when she
died. And there was a man courting her whose
name was George nă Riell, and the two were
courting.</p>

<p>When her mother died the king made a fair
and beautiful greenawn for his three sons on an
island in the midst of the sea, and there he put
them to live; and he sent his daughter to them
with food every evening.</p>

<p>It was not long after that till he married another
wife, and by this wife he had three daughters.
She was one day walking in the garden, and she
got the corner of her apron under her foot and
she fell.</p>

<p>“May neither God nor Mary be with you,”
said the hen-wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why do you say that?” said the queen.</p>

<p>“Because the wife that was here before was
better than you.”</p>

<p>“Was there a wife before me?”</p>

<p>“There was; and that one is her daughter,
and there are three sons also in an island in the
sea, and the daughter goes every night to them
with food.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do with the three of them, to
put them to death?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” said the hen-wife, “if you will
do what I advise you.”</p>

<p>“I will do it,” said she.</p>

<p>“Promise a dowry to your eldest daughter if
she will follow the (other) daughter out when she
is going with food to her brothers.”</p>

<p>And she sent her daughter after the one who
was going with food; but she looked behind her
and saw the other coming, and she made a bog
and a lake between them, so big that she went
astray. She came to her mother, and told her she
was wandering all the night, and the mother went
to the hen-wife again and told her that her daughter
had not made her way to the men; and the hen-wife
said to her, “Promise a dowry to your second
daughter.”</p>

<p>And she did this, and the second daughter
followed as the first did, and fared in the same
way, and she came and told her mother. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the mother went again to the hen-wife, and told
her, and asked what she ought to do, and the
hen-wife said, “Promise the dowry to your third
daughter.”</p>

<p>And the third daughter followed Gilla of the
Enchantments when she was going with the food;
and she did not look behind her till she came to
the house; and she put a pot of water down, and
cut off the heads of her three brothers, and washed
them, and put them on their shoulders again. And
the half-sister was at the window looking on at
everything she did, and she went home through
the sea, before the sea returned together; and
when they ate their supper, her sister came home.</p>

<p>The mother went in the morning to the hen-wife
and told her the third woman had succeeded, and
had learned everything. And she asked her what
she should do.</p>

<p>“Say, now, that your daughter is going to be
married, and ask Gilla for the loan of the coat.
She will not know that the power of the coat will
be gone if she gives it away. So long as she keeps
the coat herself she can do everything; there are
spells on the coat that the sea must open before it,
without closing after it; but she does not know
that the spell of the coat will be lost.”</p>

<p>She gave the loan of the coat to her half-sister,
but instead of going to be married this is what she
did. When night came she put the coat on and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
went to the house of her half-brothers, knocked
at the door, and asked them to open it. And one
of the brothers said, “That is not my sister.” But
another looked out of the window and saw the
coat and recognised it, and he opened the door
and let her in. She cut the three heads off, and
took them three quarters of a mile and put them
into a hole in the ground, and went back to her
mother and told her she had killed the three. She
gave the coat back to Gilla of the Enchantments,
and Gilla went in the evening to her brothers with
food, and whatever sort of fastening the other one
put on the door she could not open it, but had
to go in by the window, and she found her three
brothers dead.</p>

<p>She wept and she screamed and pulled the hair
from her head in her lamentations, till the whiteness
of the day came upon the morrow. She had
not one head of the heads to get; but she followed
the trace of the blood, and three quarters of a mile
from the house were they in the place where they
were buried. She dug them up, and took them to
her, and washed and cleaned them, as was her
wont, and put them on the bodies, but down they
fell. She had to take them up at last, and cry to
God to do something to them, that she might see
them alive. And there were made of them three
water-dogs (? otters) and she made another of
herself. They were going in that way for a time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and then they made themselves into three doves,
and she made of herself another dove. They were
going forward and she was following, and the four
came and settled on the gable of the house, and in
the morning the man said to his wife,—</p>

<p>“There is a barrel of water. Let it be wine
with you in the evening.”</p>

<p>(He had a thought that it was not the right
woman he had got.)</p>

<p>Then said one of the brothers to the sister,—</p>

<p>“Go in, and do good in return for evil, and
make wine of the water.”</p>

<p>She went down, and when she got in, and she in
the shape of a dove, the old blind wise man, who
was lying on the bed under the window, got his
sight, and he saw her dipping her finger in the
water and making of it wine cold and wholesome.</p>

<p>And in the morning the man said to his wife,—</p>

<p>“Here is a barrel of water. Let it be wine
with you in the evening.”</p>

<p>And the second brother said to his sister,—</p>

<p>“Go in, and do good in return for evil, and
make wine of the water.”</p>

<p>She went down, and when she went in at the
window, and she in the shape of a dove, the old
wise blind man, who was lying on the bed under
the window, got his sight, and saw her dipping her
finger in the water and making it wine cold and
wholesome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>And in the morning on the third day the wise
old man spoke to the king, and said to him that
he had seen a beautiful woman come in by the
window on two days, and that he got his sight
when she came in and lost it when she went out;
and (said he) “Stretch yourself here to-day, and
when she comes in and makes wine of the water,
catch her as she is going out.”</p>

<p>And he did so, and the third brother said to his
sister,—</p>

<p>“Go down to-day, and do good in return for
evil, and make the wine.”</p>

<p>And she did this; and as she was going out the
man caught her. And when her brothers heard
that she was caught they went away. And she
asked him to give her leave to take just one look
at her brothers.</p>

<p>“Here’s the corner of my apron.”</p>

<p>And he took hold of the corner of her
apron, and she left him the apron and went
away after her brothers. When they saw her
coming again they waited for her, and she asked
them if there was anything at all in the world
that would make them alive again; and they
said there was one thing only and that hard it
was to do.</p>

<p>“What is it?” said she, “and I will try it.”</p>

<p>“To make three shirts of the ivy-leaves in a
day and a year, without uttering a word of speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
or shedding a single tear, for if you weep<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> we
shall lose one member of our members.”</p>

<p>And she said to them to make a little hut for
her in the wood, and they made the hut and went
away and left her there. She was not long till she
began to get material for the shirts, and she began
to make them; and she was not long in the house
when George nă Riell came to her, and he was
with her till she had a child to him.</p>

<p>A young man was in the wood one day and a
dog with him, and the dog took him to the place
where the woman was; and the man saw the
woman and the child there, and he went home
and told the queen that there was a beautiful
woman in the wood. And she went and took the
dog with her, as if the dog was with George nă
Riell. She went in and found the woman and the
babe, and she killed the babe and caught some of
the blood, and mixed the blood and ashes up together
and made a cake, and she sought to put a
piece of the bread into the woman’s mouth. And
the woman dropped one tear from her eye; but
the other went away home to her wedded husband,
and she said to him that great was the shame for
him to have children by that woman, and that she
had had to kill her own child and eat it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is not possible,” said he, “that she has
killed my babe.”</p>

<p>“She killed and she ate.”</p>

<p>He went to her and found the child dead; but
she did not speak a word to him. He said then
he would burn her at twelve o’clock on the next
day, and that he would put a tree of one foot and
hang her on it. He commanded that every one
should come in the morning with sods of turf and
sheets of paper and everything to make a fire.
And he put the tree standing, and she was brought
and put up on the top of the tree; and she was
sewing during this time. When it was twelve
o’clock, sign was given she should be hung, and
an old man in the crowd asked them to give her
another hour by the clock; and when the hour
was passed he asked again that they should give
her a half-hour; the woman in it (he said) was
under gassa. “You see that it is not her life that
is troubling her, but that she is always sewing.”</p>

<p>It was not long till they saw a black cloud
coming through the air, and they saw three things
in the cloud coming.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the old man, “there are three
angels from heaven, or three devils from hell,
coming for her soul.”</p>

<p>There were three black ravens coming, and
their mouths open, and as it were fire out of their
mouths, till the three black ravens came and lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
in their sister’s bosom, and she on the top of
the tree, and she put the three shirts on them,
and said,—</p>

<p>“Finn, Inn, and Brown Glegil, show that I am
your sister, for in pain am I to-day.”</p>

<p>They took hold of her and lifted her down from
the tree, and the brothers told George nă Riell
everything that the half-sister had done, first that
she killed the three of them, and afterwards that
it was she that killed their sister’s child.</p>

<p>Then she was put up on the tree, and she was
hung, and then thrown into the fire. And they
went home, and George nă Riell married Gilla of
the Enchantments and took her into his own
house, and they spent the rest of their life as
is right.</p>

<p>I don’t know what happened to them since
then.</p>

<h2 id="THE_WOMAN_WHO_WENT_TO_HELL"><i>THE WOMAN WHO WENT TO HELL.</i></h2>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">P. Minahan</span>, Malinmore, Glencolumkille,
co. Donegal.</i></p>

<p>There was a woman coming out of her
garden with an apron-full of cabbage. A
man met her. He asked her what she would
take for her burden. She said it was not worth
a great deal, that she would give it to him for
nothing. He said he would not take it, but would
buy it. She said she would only take sixpence.
He gave her the sixpence. She threw the cabbage
towards him. He said that was not what he
bought, but the burden she was carrying. Who
was there but the devil? She was troubled then.
She went home and she was weeping. It was a
short time until her young son was born. He
was growing till he was eighteen years old. He
was out one day and fell, and never rose up till he
died. When they were going to bury him, they
took him to the people’s house (<i>i.e.</i>, the chapel).
They left him there till morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a man among the neighbours who
had three daughters. He took out a box of snuff
to give (the men) a pinch. The last man to whom
the box went round left the box on the altar.
They went home. When the man was going to
bed he went looking for his box. The box was
not to be got. He said he had left it behind him
in the people’s house. He said he would not
sleep that night until he got a pinch. He asked
one of his daughters to go to the people’s house
and bring him the box that was on the altar. She
said there was loneliness on her. He cried to
the second woman, would she go? She said she
would not go; that she was lonely. He cried to
the third, would she go? And she said she would
go; that there was no loneliness on her in his
presence (<i>i.e.</i>, of the corpse).</p>

<p>She went to the people’s house. She found
the box. She put it in her pocket. When she
was coming away she saw a ring at the end of the
coffin. She caught hold of it till it came to her.
The end came from the coffin. The man that
was dead came out. He enjoined on her not to
be afraid.</p>

<p>“Do you see that fire over yonder? If you
are able, carry me to that fire.”</p>

<p>“I am not able,” said she.</p>

<p>“Be dragging me with you as well as you
can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>She put him on her back. She dragged him
till they came to the fire.</p>

<p>“Draw out the fire,” said he, “and put me
lying in the midst of it; fix up the fire over me.
Anything of me that is not burnt put the fire on
it again.”</p>

<p>He was burning till he was all burnt. When
the day was coming she was troubled on account
of what she had seen during the night. When
the day grew clear there came a young man, who
began making fun with her.</p>

<p>“I have not much mind for fun on account of
what I have seen during the night.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was I who was there,” said the young
man.</p>

<p>“I would go to heaven if I could get an angel
made by you left in my father’s room.”</p>

<p>Three quarters (of a year) from that night she
dressed herself up as if she was a poor woman.
She went to his father’s house and asked for
lodging till morning. The woman of the house
said that they were not giving lodging to any
poor person at all. She said she would not ask
but a seat by the fire. The man of the house
told her to stay till morning. She stopped. They
went both to lie down. She sat by the fire. In
the course of the night she went into the room,
and there she had a young son. He, <i>i.e.</i>, her
husband, came in at the window in the shape of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
white dove. He dressed the child. The child
began to cry. The woman of the house heard
the crying. She would wager the lady had left a
baby after her. She rose to get out of the bed.
Her husband told her to lie quiet and have
patience. She got up in spite of him. The door
of the room was shut. She looked in through
the keyhole. He was standing on the floor. She
perceived it was her son who was there. She
cried to him, was it he that was there? He said
it was.</p>

<p>“One glance of your eye has sent me for seven
years to hell.”</p>

<p>“I will go myself in your place,” said his
mother.</p>

<p>She went then to go to hell. When she came
to the gate, there came out steam so that she was
burnt and scalded. It was necessary for her to
return. “Well,” said the father, “I will go in
your place.” It was necessary for him to return.
The young man began to weep. He said he must
go himself. The mother of the child said that
she would go.</p>

<p>“Here is a ring for you,” said he. “When
thirst comes on you, or hunger, put the ring in
your mouth; you will feel neither thirst nor
hunger. This is the work that will be on you—to
keep down the souls; they are stewing and
burning in the boiler. Do not eat a bit of food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
there. There is a barrel in the corner, and all the
food that you get throw into the barrel.”</p>

<p>She went to hell then. She was keeping down
the souls in the boiler. They were rising in leaps
out of it. All the food she got she threw into the
barrel till the seven years were over. She was
making ready to be going then. The devil came
to her. He said she could not go yet awhile till
she had paid for the food she had eaten. She
said she had not eaten one morsel of his share:
“All that I got, it is in the barrel.” The devil
went to the barrel. All he had given her was
there for him.</p>

<p>“How much will you take to stay seven years
more?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am long enough with you,” said she;
“if you give me the all that I can carry, I can
stay with you.”</p>

<p>He said he would give it. She stopped. She
was keeping down the souls during seven years.
She was shortening the time as well as she could
till the seven years were ended. Then she was
going. When the souls saw she was going they
rose up with one cry, lest one of them should
be left. They went clinging to her; they
were hanging to her hair all that were in the
boiler. She moved on with her burden. She
had not gone far when a lady in a carriage
met her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! great is your burden,” said the lady;
“will you give it to me?”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” said she.</p>

<p>“I am the Virgin Mary.”</p>

<p>“I will not give it to you.”</p>

<p>She moved on with herself. She had not gone
far when a gentleman met her.</p>

<p>“Great is your burden, my poor woman; will
you give it to me?”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” said she.</p>

<p>“I am God,” said he.</p>

<p>“I will not give my burden to you.”</p>

<p>She went on with herself another while.
Another gentlemen met her.</p>

<p>“Great is the burden you have,” said the
gentleman; “will you give it to me?”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” said she.</p>

<p>“I am the King of Sunday,” said he.</p>

<p>“I will give my burden to you,” said she. “No
rest had I ever in hell except on Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is a good woman you are; the first
lady you met it was the devil was there; the
second person you met it was the devil was
there, trying if they could get your burden from
you back. Now,” said God, “the man for whom
you have done all this is going to be married
to-morrow. He thought you were lost since you
were in that place so long. You will not know
till you are at home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not know till she was at home. The
house was full of drinking and music. She went
to the fire. Her own son came up to her.</p>

<p>She was making him wonder she was so worn
and wasted. She told the child to go to his father
and get a glass of whisky for her to drink. The
child went crying to look for his father. He asked
his father to give him a glass of whisky. His
father gave it. He came down where she was by
the fire. He gave her the glass. She drank it,
there was so much thirst on her. The ring that
her husband gave her she put in the glass.</p>

<p>“Put your hand over the mouth of the glass;
give it to no one at all till you hand it to your
father.”</p>

<p>The lad went to his father. He gave him the
glass. The father looked into it, and saw the
ring. He recognised the ring.</p>

<p>“Who has given you this?” said he.</p>

<p>“A poor woman by the fire,” said the lad.</p>

<p>The father raised the child on his shoulders that
he might point out to him the woman who had
given him the ring. The child came to the poor
woman.</p>

<p>“That is the woman,” said he, “who gave me
the ring.”</p>

<p>The man recognised her then. He said that
hardly did he know her when she came so worn
and wasted. He said to all the people that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
would never marry any woman but this one; that
she had done everything for him; that his mother
sold him to the devil, and the woman had earned
him back; that she had spent fourteen years in
hell, and now she had returned.</p>

<p>This is a true story. They are all lies but this
one.</p>

<h2 id="THE_KING_WHO_HAD_TWELVE_SONS"><i>THE KING WHO HAD TWELVE SONS.</i></h2>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">John McGinty</span>, Valley, Achill Island.</i></p>

<p>He went down to the river every day and
killed a salmon for each one of them.
He saw a duck on the river and twelve (young)
birds with her; and she was beating the twelfth
away from her. He went to the old druid and
asked what was the cause why the duck was
beating away the twelfth bird from her.</p>

<p>“It was this,” said the old druid; “she gave
the bird to God and the Djachwi.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have twelve sons,” said the king;
“I will give one of them to God and to the
Djachwi, as the duck is giving one of her birds
to God and the Djachwi. The twelve are going
to school, and you must tell me which of them
it is best for me to give away.”</p>

<p>“Whichever of them is last at the gate in the
evening, that is the man you will give away; and
whatever money you have left out to give him
throw it to him over the gate, and tell him he
must go and seek his own fortune.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>The younger children were running on first
to the house, being hungry, and the eldest was
coming, reading a book, after them. The father
was standing at the gate on the inside, and he
threw him a purse of money, and told him he
must go seek his fortune, that he gave him to
God and to the Djachwi.</p>

<p>He went and spent that night with the old
druid. He rose in the morning and washed his
face, and prayed to God to put him in luck again
until evening. He gave a good heap of the gold
to the old druid. The old druid gave him a card
and a bridle, and told him that any beast he would
rub the card to, if his skin was full of disease,
would be cured.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He went away that morning
and he met with a king upon the road. The
king asked him,—</p>

<p>“What are you seeking?”</p>

<p>“I am seeking a master,” said he.</p>

<p>“Your like is what I am wanting,” said the
king. “I have three hundred horses and there is
not one of them fit to put to my carriage, they
are so full of lumps in their skin.”</p>

<p>“I am able to cure them,” said the other.</p>

<p>“How much do you ask till the end of a day
and a year?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be asking of you nothing at all but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
beast that comes and puts the head in this bridle
mine.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the king.</p>

<p>He was a good serving-boy, and he minded the
horses. He was not two days with his master
when two of them were cured, fit to go with the
carriage. He went every evening to an old
couple, and he used to get news in plenty from
them.</p>

<p>“Did you hear the great news there is to-night?”</p>

<p>“I did not hear. What is the news?”</p>

<p>“The daughter of the King of the great Wren
is to be devoured to-morrow by a piast.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>“I did not hear it,” said he.</p>

<p>“Was it in a wood or a hole in the ground
you’ve been that you didn’t hear it? Gentle and
simple of the three islands are to be there to-morrow
to look at the piast swallowing her—at
twelve o’clock to-morrow.”</p>

<p>(The next day) when he found that every one
was gone to the place where the piast was to come
on land, he called out for his second best suit of
clothes, and it came to him with a leap; and he
shook the bridle, and the ugliest pony in the stables
came to him and put her head into the bridle.
“Be up riding on me with a jump” (said the pony)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
lowering himself on his two knees. He gave his
face to the way and he would overtake the wind
of March that was before him, and the wind of
March that was after would not overtake him.
When he came in sight of the place where the
gathering was, the piast was coming till she was
half upon the land; and he and the piast went
fighting, till he tore her with his mouth and feet.</p>

<p>He came back and gave his face to the way,
and he ran so near to the place where the king’s
daughter was to be swallowed that she caught the
boot from the foot of the man who was riding
on the pony. He came home and attended to
his horses, and no one knew who was the man
who was mounted on the pony that killed the
piast. She proclaimed a gathering of all the men
in the three islands, that she might see who the
man was whom the shoe fitted. There was not
a man at all coming whom the shoe would fit,
and she was not going to marry any man but the
one whom the shoe fitted. The old man said it
was right for him to go to her to see if the shoe
would fit him. He called for the suit of clothes
that he wore on the day when the pony killed the
piast, and he went to her (the king’s daughter).
She knew him at once. The shoe was in her
hand, and it leaped from her hand till it went on
his foot.</p>

<p>“You are the man that was on the pony on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
day that he killed the piast, and you are the man
whom I will marry.”</p>

<p>He was seven nights and seven days at feast
and festival, and they were married on the eighth
day. They spent that night part in talking and
part in story-telling; till the early day came and
the clear brightness on the morrow morning.</p>

<p>He said to her that he would be riding in
the morning on the pony; and he was going, and
he came on an apple of gold upon the strand, and
the pony told him not to take up the apple or it
would give him abundance of trouble.</p>

<p>“Whatever trouble it may give me I will take
it up!”</p>

<p>He went home and the pearl of gold with him.
In the morning he went to the old druid, and the
old druid told him that it was the daughter of a
king of the eastern world, who lost it from her
hair;—that there was a pearl of gold on every
rib of hair upon her head, and that she and her
twelve attendant women were bathing in such a
place the day she lost it.</p>

<p>“I will never stop,” said he, “till I see the
woman who lost it.”</p>

<p>The pony told him she was hard to see.</p>

<p>“There are seven miles of hill on fire to cross
before you come to where she is, and there are
seven miles of steel thistles, and seven miles of sea
for you to go over. I told you to have nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to do with the apple. All the same it is as good
for you to go riding on me till we try to go to
her place.”</p>

<p>He went on his two knees, and he went riding
on him, till he crossed the seven miles of hill on
fire, and the seven miles of steel thistles, and the
seven miles of sea. When they came to the castle
in which she was, there was a great dinner that
day with her, and a great gathering of company.
There were three-and-twenty feet of moat to cross
before the pony could get in. He rose with a
high leap and crossed the three-and-twenty feet.
He came down on the inside of the moat, and a
report went in (to the castle) that such and such a
stranger was there; and she heard it and sent one
of her servants to him. He told the servant he
could not go in till he got leave to put the pony
in the stable. She herself came out to him, with
a golden goblet in her hand full of wine, and she
offered it to him; but he said he would be obliged
to her if she would drink of it first. She drank
some of the wine first, and then held it out to
him; and what he did was to leap again upon the
pony, and throw his arm round her waist, and lift
her up beside him on the pommel; and the pony
gave his head towards the gates and crossed out
beyond them, and made no stop till he came to
their own castle with the lady.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the pony, “strike a blow with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
your rod of druidism upon me, and make of me
a rock of stone, and whatever time at all you are
in need of me, you have nothing to do but strike
another blow on me, and I am up as I was
before.”</p>

<p>The woman was with him then; and the young
queen he first married did not know there was
such a person in the castle till the hen-wife told
her. “Well!” said the hen-wife, “do you know
what to do? He has no regard for you beside
the other. There is an apple of gold on every
rib of hair upon her head. You and he will be
(playing cards) together to-night, and you will
win the first game, and you will put him under
bonds to go and bring you the black horse of the
bank.”</p>

<p>The two went playing that night. She won
the first game, and he was to bring her the
black horse of the bank. He went to the pony
and struck a blow with his rod of druidism on
him, and told her the news, that she put him
under bonds to bring her the black horse of the
bank. “I told you the first day,” said the pony,
“to leave the pearl alone, or it would give you
abundance of trouble; you must go now and
cover me with leather all over, and put pitch and
tar on the outside of the leather. I will then go
down to the cliff to fight with the black horse of the
bank, till I see if I’ll be able to bring him to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
There is not a bit that he takes out of me that he
will not get the full of his mouth of leather and
pitch and tar, to my ribs.”</p>

<p>He went down, and he and the horse were
fighting till he brought him down from the cliff
to him, and he brought him home to his wife.
She went then again to the hen-wife, to get more
information from her. The hen-wife told her
that unless she could win another game on him,
and put him under bonds to bring her the skin of
the wild pig from the eastern world, he and this
young queen would put her to death. The two
went playing that night, and he won the first
game from her, and she said to him, “Give your
judgment now.” “I perceive,” said he, “that
if it was you who had to give the first judgment,
you would give a brief judgment on me. But
now I put you under bonds to go, and not to
sleep a wink, but for one night only in the one
house, till you bring me the heads of the three
black ravens that are in the eastern world.”</p>

<p>She arose in the morning and went to the
hen-wife, and told her: and the hen-wife said,
“She had plenty of trouble before her ere she got
the three black ravens from the eastern world.
But now I have three brothers who are three
giants, and to-night you will be with the first of
them. I will give you a ring that will take you
on your way swiftly to the king, and when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
come to him you will give him the ring, and he
will know who gave it to you. And great will be
the welcome he will have for you, and he will
give you every knowledge as far as the next
brother.”</p>

<p>She gave her the ring, and she was with him
that night, and he told her that “he himself was
as much as third of the world, that his second
brother was two-thirds of the world, and the third
brother three-thirds, and that all the birds of the
air were under high tribute to him.”</p>

<p>She arose in the morning and washed her face
and hands, and prayed to God, to put her in
luck; and that night she was with the second
brother; and the third night she was with the
third brother. She gave him the ring and he
recognised it, and said he had not seen his sister
for a hundred years. She told him the journey
she was going.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> “To-morrow,” said he, “they
are coming with their high tribute, and unless I
can get tidings from them I cannot give you
tidings.” Then in the morning came all the
birds of the air and paid to him their tribute, all
except the eagle: “And great is my wonder,”
said he, “that the eagle is last to-day, and no
tidings are there with any other bird, unless it is
with the eagle.” He blew a whistle, and it was
not long till he saw a black lump coming in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
sky, and who was it but the eagle! He told the
eagle he would remit to him the tribute of the
seven years, if he could give him tidings of the
three black ravens that are in the eastern world.
“Well!” said he, “it is a year and a day since I
saw them, and I’ll take another year and a day
before I can come to you with account of them.”
“You must wait here” (said he to the woman)
“to the end of a year and a day till the eagle
comes back to me with news, and you will have
nothing to do but sit down.”</p>

<p>When the day and the year were ended, the
eagle came back and the three black ravens with
him, and he gave them to the giant, and the
giant took them from him. “And now” (said
he) “when you go home he will ask you if you
have them, and you will say you have not; and
he will say he believes you never went at all to
look for them, and you will take them with you
then, and show them to him and let them out of
your hand, and they will not stop till they come
to me here.”</p>

<p>When she came home her husband said to her,—“Have
you the three ravens?”</p>

<p>“If I promised to bring them to you, I did not
promise to give them to you.” And she let them
away.</p>

<p>He went that night to the old druid he had
himself, and he told him the thing she said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
him. And the old druid told him that unless he
could succeed in banishing the hen-wife from the
castle she would bring utter destruction on himself
and the queen. “Go now, and there is not any
way to banish her but the way I tell you. Send
her word this night, and invite her to play cards
with you; and when you win the first game tell
her she must go to the Gruagach of the Apple
and bring to you the sword of light that is with
the King of Rye, and then she has not a single
chance of returning. The queen will have no
one to tell her anything without the hen-wife, and
you yourself and the other queen will be quiet
and untroubled together then.”</p>

<p>He sent her word that night and she came, and
he asked her would she play a game of cards?
She said she would play: that great was the
practice she learned in the house of her father and
mother when she was young, and that she was
very proud that he paid her a compliment so great
as to invite her. He drew out a table and a pack
of cards, and the two sat down beside the table,
and it was five hundreds they had in the game.
He succeeded until she put out the five hundreds.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the hen-wife, “give your judgment
on me.”</p>

<p>“I put you under bonds and under curse of a
year to go to the eastern world and to bring the
sword of light belonging to the King of Rye from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the eastern world, and not to sleep a wink, but
one night only, in the one house before you come
back again.”</p>

<p>She went with herself, and stopped not till she
came to the castle of the King of Rye in the
eastern world, and knocked at the Cuillë Coric,
and the King of Rye came out and asked her
what she was seeking.</p>

<p>“I am seeking,” said she, “your sword of light
and the divided stone of your druidism.”</p>

<p>“Well, do you not see on the hill yonder all
the heads of the champions who came to seek
them from me, and never went man of them back
to tell the story? and you are come, a woman,
to seek!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said she, “it was not under protection
of your shield I came at all, but under the
protection of my own shield and blade.”</p>

<p>She and the King of Rye then went at one
another, and the King of Rye was getting the
better of her, and she asked him to give her
quarter for her life till morning.</p>

<p>“Hold out your hand till I cut off the tips of
your little finger that I may be able to recognise
you, and you will not get quarter for your life but
this turn, (not) if you come to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She went with herself and stopped that night
at the smith’s house; and the smith said to her,—</p>

<p>“It’s a bad journey you’ve come on your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
two feet. Many’s the good champion I’ve seen
crossing yonder bridge, and a man of them to
tell the story came back never. Unless you do
the thing I tell you, you will get the like death.
Go to-night,” said he, “and rise in the morning,
and I will give you a sword if you pay me for my
service; and I will cut off the tip of the little finger
on your other hand, and you will go to the hall-door
at the time when he is at his breakfast, and
he will ask you, ‘Haven’t you a sudden desire
to die that you come to me so early?’”</p>

<p>She went in the morning to the hall-door of the
King of Rye, and he said to her,—</p>

<p>“Sudden is your desire to die since you come
to me so early, and haven’t given me leave to eat
my breakfast; but that is the thing that will make
your own life shorter. Stretch out your hand that
I may see if it was you were here yesterday.”</p>

<p>She stretched out her two hands and he found
the tips of her two little fingers were cut off, and
he said she must have got advice from the smith
when she did that. She took up from the ground
the sword the smith gave her. When he saw the
sword he begged for quarter for his life, for he
knew the sword was equal to half the world, and
that it was no good for him to fight against it.
He said he would give her all he ever saw upon
the earth, but would not face that sword she
had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am asking nothing of you except your
sword of light and the divided stone of your
druidism.”</p>

<p>“Those are the two things that it is worst for
me to part from.”</p>

<p>He went in and brought them out to her, and she
went with herself to the smith, and she spent that
night at the smith’s house, and gave him a good
hansel of gold for the sword he gave her. “Now,”
said the smith, “though he put you under bonds
to bring the sword to him, you did not promise
more than to bring it to him. When you come
to him and the things with you, and you take
them up in your two hands and show them to
him, you will say, though you promised to bring
them to him, you did not promise to bring them
for him and you will let them go, and they will
be with me here in the winking of your eye.
Unless they come back to me, the King of Rye
will put me to death, as he knows I gave you my
sword; and there will be peace made between him
and me, and the quarrel between us will be at an
end.”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>And when the first wife saw the second wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
with her own eyes, she could esteem herself no
longer, and she died of a broken heart.</p>

he was unable to relate the further developments of this
remarkable game of plot and counterplot. Although the
hen-wife was successful in the last event mentioned, it
must be inferred that she was ultimately defeated. I
believe there are other deficiencies in the story. One
hears nothing more of the skin of the wild pig after its
first mention, p. 203. The same remark applies to the
Gruagach of the Apple, p. 206. On the other hand, “the
divided stone of druidism” is brought in without explanation.
It had not been asked for.</p>

<h2 id="THE_RED_PONY"><i>THE RED PONY.</i></h2>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">P. Minahan</span>, Malinmore, co. Donegal.</i></p>

<p>There was a poor man there. He had a
great family of sons. He had no means
to put them forward. He had them at school.
One day, when they were coming from school, he
thought that whichever of them was last at the
door he would keep him out. It was the youngest
of the family was last at the door. The father
shut the door. He would not let him in. The
boy went weeping. He would not let him in till
night came. The father said he would never let
him in; that he had boys enough.</p>

<p>The lad went away. He was walking till night.
He came to a house on the rugged side of a
hill on a height, one feather giving it shelter
and support. He went in. He got a place till
morning. When he made his breakfast in the
morning, he was going. The man of the house
made him a present of a red pony, a saddle, and
bridle. He went riding on the pony. He went
away with himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now,” said the pony, “whatever thing you
may see before you, don’t touch it.”</p>

<p>They went on with themselves. He saw a
light before him on the high-road. When he
came as far as the light, there was an open box
on the road, and a light coming up out of it. He
took up the box. There was a lock of hair in it.</p>

<p>“Are you going to take up the box?” said
the pony.</p>

<p>“I am. I cannot go past it.”</p>

<p>“It’s better for you to leave it,” said the pony.</p>

<p>He took up the box. He put it in his pocket.
He was going with himself. A gentleman met
him.</p>

<p>“Pretty is your little beast. Where are you
going?”</p>

<p>“I am looking for service.”</p>

<p>“I am in want of one like you, among the
stable boys.”</p>

<p>He hired the lad. The lad said he must get
room for the little beast in the stable. The
gentleman said he would get it. They went
home then. He had eleven boys. When they
were going out into the stable at ten o’clock each
of them took a light but he. He took no candle
at all with him.</p>

<p>Each of them went to his own stable. When
he went into his stable he opened the box. He
left it in a hole in the wall. The light was great.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
It was twice as much as in the other stables.
There was wonder on the boys what was the
reason of the light being so great, and he without
a candle with him at all. They told the master
they did not know what was the cause of the light
with the last boy. They had given him no candle,
and he had twice as much light as they had.</p>

<p>“Watch to-morrow night what kind of light he
has,” said the master.</p>

<p>They watched the night of the morrow. They
saw the box in the hole that was in the wall, and
the light coming out of the box. They told the
master. When the boys came to the house, the
king asked him what was the reason why he did
not take a candle to the stable, as well as the other
boys. The lad said he had a candle. The king
said he had not. He asked him how he got the
box from which the light came. He said he had
no box. The king said he had, and that he must
give it to him; that he would not keep him
unless he gave him the box. The boy gave it to
him. The king opened it. He drew out the
lock of hair, in which was the light.</p>

<p>“You must go,” said the king, “and bring me
the woman, to whom the hair belongs.”</p>

<p>The lad was troubled. He went out. He
told the red pony.</p>

<p>“I told you not to take up the box. You will
get more than that on account of the box.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
When you have made your breakfast to-morrow,
put the saddle and bridle on me.”</p>

<p>When he made his breakfast on the morning of
the morrow, he put saddle and bridle on the pony.
He went till they came to three miles of sea.</p>

<p>“Keep a good hold now. I am going to give
a jump over the sea. When I arrive yonder there
is a fair on the strand. Every one will be coming
up to you to ask for a ride, because I am such
a pretty little beast. Give no one a ride. You
will see a beautiful woman drawing near you, her
in whose hair was the wonderful light. She will
come up to you. She will ask you to let her ride
for a while. Say you will and welcome. When
she comes riding, I will be off.”</p>

<p>When she came to the sea, she cleared the
three miles at a jump. She came upon the land
opposite, and every one was asking for a ride
upon the beast, she was that pretty. He was
giving a ride to no one. He saw that woman in
the midst of the people. She was drawing near.
She asked him would he give her a little riding.
He said he would give it, and a hundred welcomes.
She went riding. She went quietly till she got out
of the crowd. When the pony came to the sea
she made the three-mile jump again, the beautiful
woman along with her. She took her home to
the king. There was great joy on the king to
see her. He took her into the parlour. She said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to him, she would not marry any one until he
would get the bottle of healing water that was in
the eastern world. The king said to the lad he
must go and bring the bottle of healing water
that was in the eastern world to the lady. The lad
was troubled. He went to the pony. He told
the pony he must go to the eastern world for the
bottle of healing water that was in it, and bring
it to the lady.</p>

<p>“My advice was good,” said the pony, “on
the day you took the box up. Put saddle and
bridle on me.”</p>

<p>He went riding on her. They were going till
they came to the sea. She stood then.</p>

<p>“You must kill me,” said the pony; “that, or
I must kill you.”</p>

<p>“It is hard to me to kill you,” said the boy.
“If I kill you there will be no way to myself.”</p>

<p>He cut her belly down. He opened it up.
She was not long opened when there came two
black ravens and one small one. The two
ravens went into the body. They drank their
fill of the blood. When they came out the
little raven went in. He closed the belly of the
pony. He would not let the little bird come
out till he got the bottle of healing water was in
the eastern world. The ravens were very troubled.
They were begging him to let the little bird out.
He said he would not let it out till they brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
him the bottle. They went to seek the bottle.
They came back and there was no bottle with
them. They were entreating him to let the bird
out to them. He would not let the bird out till
he got the bottle. They went away again for
the bottle. They came at evening. They were
tossed and scorched, and they had the bottle.
They came to the place where the pony was.
They gave the bottle to the boy. He rubbed
the healing water to every place where they were
burned. Then he let out the little bird. There
was great joy on them to see him. He rubbed
some of the healing water to the place where he
cut the pony. He spilt a drop into her ear. She
arose as well as she ever was. He had a little
bottle in his pocket. He put some of the healing
water into it. They went home.</p>

<p>When the king perceived the pony coming he
rose out. He took hold of her with his two
hands. He took her in. He smothered her with
kisses and drowned her with tears: he dried her
with finest cloths of silk and satin.</p>

<p>This is what the lady was doing while they were
away. She boiled pitch and filled a barrel, and
that boiling. Now she went beside it and stripped
herself. She rubbed the healing water to herself.
She came out; she went to the barrel, naked.
She gave a jump in and out of the barrel. Three
times she went in and out. She said she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
never marry any one who could not do the same.
The young king came. He stripped himself.
He went to the barrel. He fell half in, half out.</p>

<p>He was all boiled and burned. Another gentleman
came. He stripped himself. He gave a
jump into the barrel. He was burned. He came
not out till he died. After that there was no one
going in or out. The barrel was there, and no
one at all was going near it. The lad went up to
it and stripped himself. He rubbed the healing
water on himself. He came to the barrel. He
jumped in and out three times. He was watching
her. She came out. She said she would never
marry any one but him.</p>

<p>Came the priest of the pattens, and the clerk of
the bells. The pair were married. The wedding
lasted three nights and three days. When it was
over, the lad went to look at the place where the
pony was. He never remembered to go and see
the pony during the wedding. He found nothing
but a heap of bones. There were two champions
and two young girls playing cards. The lad went
crying when he saw the bones of the pony. One
of the girls asked what was the matter with him.
He said it was all one to her; that she cared
nothing for his troubles.</p>

<p>“I would like to get knowledge of the cause
why you are crying.”</p>

<p>“It is my pony who was here. I never remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to see her during the wedding. I have
nothing now but her bones. I don’t know what I
shall do after her. It was she who did all that I
accomplished.”</p>

<p>The girl went laughing. “Would you know
your pony if you saw her?”</p>

<p>“I would know,” said he.</p>

<p>She laid aside the cards. She stood up.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that your pony?” said she.</p>

<p>“It is,” he said.</p>

<p>“I was the pony,” said the girl, “and the two
ravens who went in to drink my blood my two
brothers. When the ravens came out, a little bird
went in. You closed the pony. You would not
let the little bird out till they brought the bottle
of healing water that was in the eastern world.
They brought the bottle to you. The little bird
was my sister. It was my brothers were the
ravens. We were all under enchantments. It is
my sister who is married to you. The enchantments
are gone from us since she was married.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_NINE-LEGGED_STEED"><i>THE NINE-LEGGED STEED.</i></h2>

<p class="by"><i>Narrator, <span class="smcap">P. Minahan</span>, Malinmore, co. Donegal.</i></p>

<p>There was a king and a queen. They had
but one son. The queen died. He married
another queen. The queen was good to the child.
She took care of him till he was a young man.
She sent him away to learn chivalry. When he
came home there was great joy on the queen.
When he had rested at home, he and the huntsman
went hunting on the mountain. They found
no game at all. They came to the lake. They
sat down on a height beside the lake. They
saw three swans coming towards the height.
They rested on the lake. They swam in under
the place where they were sitting. They came on
the shore. They threw off them the transforming
caps. They arose the three maidens. One woman
of them was very comely. They came up to the
young men. The comely woman was there. She
and the king’s son were talking until night.
When they were going she asked him would he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
be there the next day. He said he would. The
women went on the shore. They put on the
transforming caps. They went away the three
swans. The young men came home. There
was great joy on the young queen. She asked
the huntsman what kind of sport they had. He
said they had none at all; that three swans came
from the eastern direction; that they had settled
on the lake; that they swam in to the place where
they were sitting; that they rose up on the
beach; that they threw off the transforming caps;
that they rose the three maidens; that one of
them was very beautiful; that he himself and the
king’s son were talking with the girl.</p>

<p>The young queen said they were done with
his master. “I will give you five pounds if you
put the slumber-pin in his clothes. He will fall
asleep then. She won’t get a word of talk from
him. He will be sleeping.”</p>

<p>The young man said he would do it. They
took their supper. They went to lie down.
When day came they arose. They washed themselves.
They took their breakfast. They went
hunting. They found no sport at all till they
came to the lake. They sat down on a pretty
hillock. They saw the three swans coming.
They settled on the lake. They came in on the
shore. They threw off them the transforming
caps. They rose the three maidens. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
son of the king and the huntsman sat down, the
huntsman put the slumber-pin in his clothes. He
fell asleep. The girls came up. They sat by
his side.</p>

<p>“Great is the sleep that’s on your master to-day.”</p>

<p>“That is no wonder for him,” said the huntsman.
“He does not sleep one night at home, but is out
rambling and courting.”</p>

<p>She was shaking him to wake him. She failed
to wake him till it was time for her to be going.
She said to the young man, “Tell your master
we will come here to-morrow; unless he is awake
to-morrow to speak to us, we will come no more.”</p>

<p>They went away then. They put on them the
transforming caps. They went away again the
three swans. The young man took out the
slumber-pin from his master’s clothes. He awoke
then. They went home then. He was not
speaking a word. The young queen asked the
huntsman how it happened with him to-day? He
said it happened well; that he put him asleep
to-day.</p>

<p>“A good man you are,” said she. “Here are
five pounds more for you. Do the same to-morrow.”</p>

<p>They took their supper. They went to lie
down. When the day came on the morrow, they
arose and took their breakfast. The king’s son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
said to the huntsman that he would not go with
him to-day; that it was he was doing something
or other to him.</p>

<p>“It is not I,” said the huntsman.</p>

<p>The king’s son went out. The huntsman
followed him. When they were coming near the
lake, he could not fasten the slumber-pin in him.
When they were coming to the place where they
sat he threw the slumber-pin. He got it fastened
in his frock. He fell asleep on the instant. He
took hold of him; he drew him to the place
where they used to sit. He sat down by his side.
The three swans came. They settled on the lake.
They swam in to the shore. They threw off them
the transforming caps. They rose the three
maidens. They came again to the place where
the young men were.</p>

<p>“Is your master asleep to-day?”</p>

<p>“He is; he has not slept a wink at home for
three nights.”</p>

<p>She was shaking him to try if she could wake
him. She failed. When she was going, “Say
to your master that he will never see sight of me
while streams run or grass grows.”</p>

<p>They went away then. The huntsman took
the slumber-pin out. Then he awoke. He
looked up at the sun. Night was at hand. He
asked were the maidens there that day. The
young man said they were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did they say when they were going?”</p>

<p>“They said you would never have a sight of
them while streams run or grass grows.”</p>

<p>“Don’t come near me or I will kill you.”</p>

<p>Fear would not let the huntsman come near
him. They went home then. The young queen
asked the young man were the maidens with them
that day. The young man said they were.</p>

<p>“What did they say to you?”</p>

<p>“They said you would not see a sight of them
while streams run or grass grows.”</p>

<p>“You are done with her,” said the queen.</p>

<p>They took their supper then and went to lie
down. When the day came he arose and washed.
He took his breakfast. He said good-bye to
them. He said he would not sleep a second time
for one night in one house; that he would wear
his legs to his knees till he got one sight of that
woman.</p>

<p>He went with himself then. He was walking
till it was night. He saw not a house at all that
would give him lodging. He saw one house on
the side of a hill, one feather giving it support
and shelter. He went into the house. A horse-beast
spoke to him from the side. He gave
welcome to the son of the King of Erin.</p>

<p>“Go down to the fire and warm yourself; when
you have warmed yourself, go to the room, and
there is food and drink on the table: don’t be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
afraid of anything at all. Nothing will happen to
you till morning. When you have eaten enough
come down and lie here on the grass under my
head that I may talk with you.”</p>

<p>He came down and sat on the grass: “Have
no wonder at anything you see.”</p>

<p>It was not long till he heard a troop coming
into the house. Three seals came in. They
came into the room. They threw off the transforming
caps. They sat down to dinner. The
son of the king wondered when he saw the three
seals coming in. It was not long till he heard
them talking and laughing. Said the eldest of
them,—</p>

<p>“If I had the son of the King of Erin here I
would give on him a gift. I would give him an
apple. There is not a going astray, nor any
(trouble), let him throw the apple in the air, there
would come a court and castle in the track; there
would come food and drink in the track.”</p>

<p>Said the second son, “If I had the son of the
King of Erin here, I would give him a ring; and
there is not a battle or breaking that would come
on him, let him raise the ring between himself
and his (enemies) he would blind them and kill
them all.”</p>

<p>Said the son that was youngest, “If I had the
son of the King of Erin here, I would give him
the nine-legged steed for his riding.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Get up now,” said the nine-legged steed; “get
up and shake yourself out of the grass. Go
forward. You will find three champions as handsome
as ever you saw. Salute them as politely as
you can. Tell them you hope they will not be
worse than their promise.”</p>

<p>He went forward and saluted them. He took
them by the hand. He sat in their company till
morning. When the day came they were going.
They left a breakfast on the table. They gave
him the three gifts. They went then and put on
the transforming caps. They went away as three
seals. The son of the king came down then, and
sat under the beast’s head.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the nine-legged steed, “I have
one fault, that a rider never gets on me but I
must throw him three times. When you take
your breakfast, get a saddle and bridle; put them
on me. Take me down to the soft ground; go
riding on me, and I must throw you.”</p>

<p>He took his breakfast. He went riding on
her then. She asked him if he was ready. He
said he was.</p>

<p>“I will throw you as gently and quietly as I can.”</p>

<p>She walked a couple of steps. She lifted her
rump and flung him. He was jerked up into the
air, and fell down on the back of his head.</p>

<p>She came about him. “I believe you are
killed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am not,” said he. “I am none the worse.”</p>

<p>“You are a good man,” said she; “if you stand
two other tumbles I will never throw you again.”</p>

<p>When he was rested, he went riding again.
She lifted her rump again, and jerked him into
the air. She came about him to see if he was
killed. “I believe you are killed.”</p>

<p>“I am none the worse,” said he.</p>

<p>“If you stand one more tumble, I will never
throw you again.”</p>

<p>He rested himself. He went riding again.
She asked him if he was ready. He said he was.
She flung him again and tossed him into the air.
He fell down on the back of his head. She
looked about to see if he was alive. “Now,” said
she, “I will never throw you again. Now when
you are rested, and you run to your riding, do not
pull the bridle on my head. I know where you
are going. I will bring you to the place you are
drawing to.”</p>

<p class="noindent">till she came to the door of the king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give me to no one whatever till a red boy
comes,” said the nine-legged steed.</p>

<p>The king rose out. He gave welcome to the
son of the King of Erin. Boys came up to the
horse to put her in the stable. He did not give
her to them. A red boy came. He asked would
he give her to him. She told him to give her.
They came into the parlour.</p>

<p>He got dinner then. He was eating and
drinking till it was well on in the night. The
king said then that he had an island, and that he
gained nothing by it for a long time: that Owases
were risen up on it.</p>

<p>“I am not going to give my daughter to
any one who does not kill them and clear the
island.”</p>

<p>“We will throw a look around to-morrow,”
said the son of the King of Erin.</p>

<p>When he took breakfast on the morrow-morning,
he went out to the nine-legged steed.
She told him what was to be done.</p>

<p>“Put saddle and bridle on me: go riding on
me. There are three miles of sea between the
land and the island. I will clear the three miles at
a leap. Tie me to the stump of a tree.”</p>

<p>She went forward then, and he had the ring in
his hand. The first Owas man that met him, he
raised the ring between himself and him, and
blinded him. He was killing and slaughtering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
till he killed the last on the island. He went
down to the nine-legged steed. He went riding
on her then, and she cleared the three miles. She
told him not to look behind him till he came to
the king’s door. When he came up to the gate
there was thunder and lightning, and he thought
the mid-heaven was falling, such was the rattle.
There was a great sink of mud at the door of
the hen-wife, and when he was going past by
the door he looked behind to see if there was
anything. He fell into the mud and filth. He
got up with dirt and sores on his skin. He was
all covered with them.</p>

<p>The daughter of the hen-wife asked leave of her
mother to pull him in, or the pigs would tear him.
Her mother told her to do it. She pulled him
in. She put a wisp of straw under him.</p>

<p>He asked her to go under the window of the
greenawn on her two knees. “Ask the girl is
there anything at all to do me good, if she
hopes to see the man she left behind her at the
fountain.”</p>

<p>The girl said, “Go into my father’s garden.
There is a well of fresh water there. There are
rushes beside the well. Pull three stalks. Cut
the white root. Get a bowl. Raise the full of
the bowl out of the well. Rub the white roots in
the water until they are melted. Rub the water
to his skin. He will be as well as ever he was.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>She rubbed the water then on every part of his
body. He was as well as he ever was. He had
nothing to put on him but old clothes. There
was a butler in the great house. He saw the
king’s son falling. He ran to the place. He
took away his clothes. He threw him his own
clothes. The king’s son had nothing to put on
him but the butler’s clothes. He went to the
house of the king, and he was at work like the
butler. The butler was in the king’s house in
the place of the son of the King of Erin. The
king thought it was the son of the King of Erin
that was with him. He published word through
the island to come to the wedding. The gentlemen
were gathered the next day. They went
fowling. The king’s son was carrying the dogs’
food. There came a mist on the hill, and they
lost their way. They said they would be lost.
The man who was carrying the dogs’ food said
to the king that if he would give him his daughter
in marriage he would save them all till morning.
The king said his daughter was given to a gentleman
who had come there. The gentlemen then
said that they would all be dead in the morning,
and it was better for him to tell a lie and to save
them.</p>

<p>“Well! I will give you my daughter if you
save us,” said the king.</p>

<p>He threw down the bag with the dogs’ food.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Then he got the apple that he had as a gift. He
threw it into the air. Where the apple fell there
rose a court and castle. There came food and
drink enough for a hundred men. They were
hungry, and they ate enough and drank enough.
Then they fell asleep. When they woke in the
morning, they were lying in a smooth flat of
rushes, and they sweating. There was great joy
on them. The gentleman then said he should get
the woman. When the butler came he had no
wife to get. He was vexed. He went home
then, and the woman who was in the greenawn
said she would not marry a man at all, but the
man who would ride the nine-legged steed under
the window of the greenawn. The report went
out through the island that any man at all who
would ride the nine-legged steed, had the king’s
daughter to get. The people were all gathered.
There was a great gathering there. The red boy
brought out the nine-legged steed under the
windows of the greenawn. The butler would let
no one ride till he went riding himself the first time.
Then he went riding on her. The nine-legged
steed asked him was he ready; he said he was.
She lifted her rump and jerked him up in the air.
He fell and was killed. Then there was another
rider then and he went riding. She played the
same trick with him. She was there, and no one
at all was going to ride on her. The king’s son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
went, and bought himself clothes. He put them
on. He went riding then on the nine-legged
steed. She walked up and down under the
windows of the greenawn, and she stirred not
head nor foot. The lady was looking out of the
window. When she saw him riding, she knew
him and she came down. She ran out and they
caught hold of each other by the hands. There
was great joy on her that she saw him. She
smothered him with kisses, and drowned him with
tears; she dried him with finest cloths and
with silk.</p>

<p>Came the priest of the pattens and the clerk
of the bells. The pair were married. When they
were married there were three champions there.
They asked him if he knew them. He said that
he knew them; that it was they gave him the
gifts. There came a beautiful girl then. She
asked him if he knew her. He said he did not
know.</p>

<p>“Well,” said she, “I was in the place of the
nine-legged steed, and those are my three brothers,
and I am sister to them. We were all under
spells till your wife was married.”</p>

<p>I found the ford; they the stepping-stones.
They were drowned, and I came away.</p>

<h2 id="THE_PHONETIC_TEXT"><i>THE PHONETIC TEXT.</i></h2>

<p>When folk-lore is narrated by peasants in
their own dialect, it seems desirable, for
various reasons, that the tales should be recorded
in that dialect, and not in some form of speech
differing from it more or less widely. This being
conceded, the question arises, when one takes to
recording Irish folk-lore, how the object is to be
attained. It needs but a very small acquaintance
with the ordinary Irish orthography to perceive
that, if it is adhered to, the object cannot be even
aimed at. The greatest defect in the English
language is admitted to be its extraordinary spelling.
But in this respect it is completely outdone
by Irish Gaelic, which is troubled in an aggravated
form with every evil that afflicts English.
Different sounds are written in the same way.
Identical sounds are written in different ways.
Silent letters attain to a tropical forestine luxuriance,
through which the tongue of the learner
despairs of hewing a way. There are, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
cases in which there is no indication in writing of
single sounds, and even syllables, which are actually
pronounced; and there is at least one case of a
word being written as if it began with a vowel,
while it really begins with a consonant.</p>

<p>One of the chief reasons for this state of affairs
is the attempt which has been made to represent
an exceedingly numerous and varied series of
sounds with a meagre alphabet of eighteen letters.
The system of orthography developed, though
highly ingenious, has proved entirely inadequate
to its purpose. But if this be true of the so-called
classical speech of the few educated persons, whose
original pronunciation has been to some slight
extent modified by the influence of books, far
more decidedly must it be affirmed of the actual
peasant dialects which, for two hundred years at
least, have taken each of them its own way,
uncontrolled by any central influence. Of these
the mere sounds cannot be given at all on the
basis of the common spelling. Here are two of
the simplest examples. The Donegal pronunciation
of the word “tá” cannot be written by any
device known to Irish orthography; neither can
the Kerry pronunciation of “glean.” The strange
spectacle is sometimes witnessed of an attempt to
give the actual sound of Irish words by means of
a spelling based on English values,—of Chaos
applying for help to Confusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the reasons which might be urged
generally in favour of recording folk-lore in the
dialect of the narrators, is one which is largely
peculiar to Irish tales. I will indicate it in the
briefest manner. Words are of frequent occurrence
which are not to be found in the dictionaries.
If one of these words contains the sound of <i>v</i> or
<i>w</i>, you cannot tell, if writing in the ordinary way,
whether to use <i>b</i> or <i>m</i> aspirated. If by mistake
you choose the wrong letter, you may afterwards
throw yourself or others entirely on a wrong scent.
But if the actual <i>v</i> or <i>w</i> is written, you will not be
responsible for misleading any one. It is further
to be observed that these stories constitute the
only body of matter having an intrinsic interest,
which can be used as a vehicle for placing some
considerable specimens of the spoken language
before Continental and other students, who have
little opportunity of gaining acquaintance with
it directly.</p>

<p>It is true that the difficulties in the way of
accurately writing the dialects are formidable.
Not only, as already remarked, are the sounds of
Irish exceptionally numerous and subtle in any
one dialect that may be chosen, but the dialects
are well-nigh innumerable. While certain broad
differences are characteristic of Kerry, Connaught,
and Donegal respectively, there are minor varieties
in every district, shading off in every possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
combination into those of the surrounding districts.
The native of Ballymore does not speak as the
inhabitant of Ballybeg, only two miles away; and
the native of Ballybeg probably has several pronunciations,
of which he will give you the benefit
impartially. This last statement must appear
almost incredible, but its truth is unquestionable.
I have taxed the peasants with these variations, and
they have admitted them, only observing “that’s
how the word’s said there,” <i>i.e.</i>, in that context.</p>

<p>The alphabet which now follows is the work of
Mr. James Lecky, whose untimely death was a
severe blow to the study of modern Irish. In
addition to the list here given, Mr. Lecky had
noted some additional distinctions, the precise
value of which I do not understand. I have
therefore not employed them in my own stories,
and though I have included one story written
down by himself, I have been obliged to omit
them.</p>

<p>The most important features in the foregoing
are,—(1) the use of <i>j</i>, which when initial has the
German value, to mark slenderness, when attached
to another consonant; (2) the use of <i>c</i> for broad
<i>g</i>, dictated partly by the necessity of economising
the resources of the Roman alphabet, and by the
consideration that <i>c</i>, in most alphabets of uncertain
value, and therefore sometimes entirely discarded
by phoneticians, is thereby fixed and utilised;
(3) the doubling of the vowels, a practice known
in old Irish, to indicate length. The accents thus
disappear, and, no dots to indicate aspiration being
required, the diacritics, whose number is such a
frequent source of error, are almost entirely got
rid of, the only exception being ˘ the mark of
obscurity, which may be usually omitted without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
harm, as it never appears except on an unstressed
syllable. In the Connaught and Donegal dialects
the stress is thrown forward. There are a few
exceptions, which are the following: ănsjin, ănsjo,
ănoxt, ămæsg, ălig (all), ămax, amwijh, estjæx,
estih, ăraan, anisj. All these have the stress on
the last syllable, and the final vowel is in every case
not obscure. <i>rr</i>, written in a few cases, is doubtful.
<i>rrj</i> corresponding to <i>llj</i> and <i>nnj</i> does not, I
think, occur on the coast of Connaught, and but
rarely in Donegal. The <i>j</i> is, however, really pronounced
as a separate consonant along with the
following vowel. Thus, “Tïcerr-je.”</p>

<p>The Connaught values of the letters, specially
those of Renvyle, are the basis of the alphabet.</p>

<p>The spelling of the names in the English is English phonetic, with the
exception of the use of J to denote slenderness or softness of the consonant.
English readers are now familiar with a similar use of J in the Norwegian
name Björnsen. It is equivalent to the consonantal use of English y.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_1">Page 1.</a> The “Gloss Gavlen” means simply the Grey
(cow) of the Smith, gavlen being properly gavnen—(gaibhnenn)
according to O’Donovan. The first part of the story
has no real connection with the second. The Gobaun seer,
meaning the Smith-builder, was the famous mythic architect,
to whom was attributed the erection of various actual
edifices,—of which I can only recall at present the Round
Tower of Killala. The latter part of the narrative is a genuine
folk-reminiscence of some of the most striking characters and
events in the oldest Irish mythology. Balar of the Blows
(Bemann) was the leader of the Fohmors, the powers of
darkness and evil, in the great battle of the northern Moytura,
fought near Sligo, in which they were defeated by Lugh,
Balar’s daughter’s son, also called Ildauna—that is “of all
arts and sciences,” the Irish Apollo, or culture-hero. Of this
name, the appellation of Dul Dauna, the Blind-Stubborn,
here bestowed on him, appears to be a curious corruption.
It is interesting to compare the whole of this account with
that found by O’Donovan in Donegal. (See note to Annals
of the Four Masters—year of the world 3330.) It contains no
reference to the education by Mananaun Mac Lir, the sea-god.
It represents the Gloss as originally the property of the
smith, Gavida, which appears to be correct.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_5">Page 5.</a> “Cruahaun of Connaught,” in the modern county of
Roscommon, being separated from the nearest part of Ulster
by the county of Leitrim, we gain an idea of what a formidable
task it was to herd the Gloss. There is no mention of Ulster
in the Irish version, but McGinty told me the lake was in that
province.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#Page_6">Page 6.</a> “The Kingdoms of the Cold.” This indicates a
different geography from that of the opening, in which Balar
is located in the East. It seems to identify Balar with the
powers of the cold. For a full development of this idea,
see the writer’s poem “Moytura,” in “Fand and Other
Poems.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_10">Page 10.</a> “Morraha.” The title is curious. Binn Edin
has not been identified (it can hardly be Binn Eadar, Howth),
though the mention at the end of “Bioultach” places it
on the coast. It occurs in other tales, Connal Gulban for
example, and it seems to be famous in this kind of literature.
The present tale has, so far as I know, only one printed
variant, the “Fis fá an aon Sgeul” of Kennedy, not so interesting,
I think, as this. The story having two parts, I have
ventured to give the best version of each from two different
narrators. Substantially both are alike throughout. In the
Renvyle version of the opening, the hero is Brian Boru,
the victor of Clontarf, and the enchanter is named Flauheen
O’Neill. The woman is Flauheen’s wife. The tone is prosy,
all the picturesque incidents relating to the horse being
absent. The “story,” however, is better told than in the
Achill version, except as regards one point, which supplies
the wife’s motive for treating her husband as she did. He
had found in the woods a wild-man (geltj), whom he took into
his house, cleaned and shaved, and made a servant of. This
man became his wife’s lover, and on his detecting the fact,
she struck him with a rod of druidism, turning him first into
a kitchen block, continually kicked and maltreated. I should
have stated in the text that the brief conversation preceding
the “story” is from the Achill version. Anshgayliacht,
the name of the one-eyed monster who stole the
children, was the brother of the champion who came in the
currach. This name is strange, as it is simply an sjgeeliaxt—<i>i.e.</i>,
“the story telling.” In the Renvyle version of the conclusion,
the hero baffles the enchanter, by pretending to notice
some writing on the sword after he has given it to Flauheen.
The latter could not read, and gives it back to the other, who
immediately cuts his head off. The Achill pretext for not
giving the sword up at all,—“though I promised to bring it
as far as you, I did not promise to bring it for you,”—is
a favourite device in the island. It will be found again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
in “King Mananaun,” and twice in “The King who had
Twelve Sons.”</p>

<p>The word translated “thistles” is snæhĕdi, which usually
means needles. The narrator said it meant thistles here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_14">Page 14.</a> The bells rang: cf.,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p><a href="#Page_15">Page 15.</a> Diversion. The word was so pronounced—not
divarsion.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_31">Page 31.</a> “The Ghost and his Wives.” The word translated
churchyard usually means “church” only.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_35">Page 35.</a> I know of no parallel to this story as a whole.
“Bioultach” probably means “Yellow-hair”—“bwï-oltax.”
Is he a solar hero? There is true painting of certain sides
of Irish character in this tale; the mutual affection of the
brothers, their indifference to larger interests, must be noted.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_50">Page 50.</a> This sea-run is a fairly good specimen of this
style of composition. There are several words I am unable to
translate. As regards the style of the runs in general in Celtic
tales, I am unable to accept the view that it has anything in
common with the well-known corrupt literary Irish style. There
is this fundamental difference between the two. The bombast
and exaggeration of the written literature is seriously given,
seriously meant. In the “runs” of the oral literature the
whole description is obviously fantastic, and meant for such.
Popular taste would never have endured the laboured exaggeration
which the pedantry of half-educated scribe composers
thought so fine; nor would the outrageous accumulation of
alliterative adjectives, in which such persons indulged, have
been possible of invention by oral reciters on the spur of the
moment. The first of the runs here given shows, by the unintelligibility
of part of it, that the narrator was not inventing,
but merely giving an imperfect version to the best of his ability.
He did not know the meaning of half of it. I now add the Irish
of this run, and for the purposes of comparison two others:—</p>

<p>The next is from “King Mananaun” (see <a href="#Page_67">page 67</a>):—</p>

<p>“hlljeeăs sjï llonc woor-woxtăx woor-waxtăx cur aardi sjï

<p>The third is from “The Champion of the Red Belt” (see
<a href="#Page_86">page 86</a>):—</p>

<p id="note"><a href="#Page_48">Page 48.</a> “The molten torrent,” hile nă rïăxăn. The
translation is conjectural. From the context here something
fiery is evidently meant. The expression occurs again in
“King Mananaun” (<a href="#Page_74">page 74</a>), where the narrator thought
something very cold was intended.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_64">Page 64.</a> “King Mananaun.” The opening resembles a
story of Curtin’s. Mananaun, the sea-god, was a great enchanter;
hence, no doubt, the name of the King in this story.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_67">Page 67.</a> “The sea-run.” See note to “Bioultach.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_68">Page 68.</a> “Faugauns and Blue-Men.” The first word
appears to mean outlaws, and to be the origin of the word
“fachan” in the Scotch stories, which has hitherto not been
understood. Does Blue-men mean men stained with woad?</p>

<p><a href="#Page_74">Page 74.</a> “Nă riaxan.” See note to “Bioultach,” <a href="#note">page 48</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#Page_76">Page 76.</a> “Blauheen Blöye” appears to mean simply
“smooth blossom.” “The Amber Bracelet.” Amber is not
found in Ireland. It was formerly believed to have magical
qualities. Pliny says, “True it is that a collar of amber beads
worn about the necks of young infants is a singular preservative
to them against secret poison, and a counter-charm for
witchcraft and sorceries”; also, “The price of a small figure
of it exceeds that of a healthy living slave.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_77">Page 77.</a> “Owas.” The “owas” must be regarded as a
distinct personage in Gaelic mythology. They appear to have
been human in shape at least. They are met with several
times in the Scotch stories, where the word is written “amhus,”
pronounced “owas.” They have sometimes definite names,
of which an example occurs a little farther on.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_78">Page 78.</a> “Criers” (of the kitchen). I am not sure this is
the meaning of “clafirj.” It may mean “gluttons.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_82">Page 82.</a> This makes the fourth time the hero is killed and
revived.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_86">Page 86.</a> “The Champion of the Red Belt.” The general
tone of the story is wild and barbarous.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_86">Page 86.</a> “Providence.” The Irish is “an rjï,” a word
frequently used in these Donegal stories in this sense.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_87">Page 87.</a> Lochlann is usually supposed to mean Denmark,
but is by some held to be a purely mythical country.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_91">Page 91.</a> Another sea-run. See note to Bioultach.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_95">Page 95.</a> “Yard round the court.” Yard is the word in
the original; it means wall apparently. There are numbers
of English words in this story, such as strain (of music), bride,
cupboard, apron, destroy, alley playing ball, slaughter.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_100">Page 100.</a> The description of the hag corresponds closely
with that of the “fachan” in the Scotch stories. It is interesting
to compare the brief popular description of this monster
with the laboured style of the written literature, as may be
seen in the description of the hags in the “Cave of Keshcorran,”
Mr. S. H. O’Grady’s “Silva Gadelica.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_106">Page 106.</a> The story of “Jack” has been given as a sample
of the humorous story—quite different, it will be seen, from the
style of Kennedy, or of any writer who uses “broken English.”
I have many others. I do not understand how they come so
often to be called “Jack,” as they are, in the Irish.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_107">Page 107.</a> Cleeve, an Irish word for basket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#Page_115">Page 115.</a> “The Servant of Poverty.” This curious story,
with its prosaic details, is chiefly remarkable for the variant
it contains of the Cymbeline legend. A version much wilder
than this is found in Campbell’s “The Chest.” The tale is
thus seen to belong to the three kingdoms. A parallel to the
opening incident of the betrothal of two children born at the
same time will be found in the story of “The Wicked Greek
Girl,” given in Latin in “Silva Gadelica.” Mr. O’Grady says
it is not an Irish story.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_121">Page 121.</a> “Collegian.” This is the word in the original,
and seems to mean “a swell.” The three sayings about
bridge, house, and nag, also occur in Campbell’s “Baillie
Lunnain.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_125">Page 125.</a> “Covered the money”—<i>i.e.</i>, with her hand:
accepted it.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_139">Page 139.</a> “The Son of the King of Prussia.” Perhaps
the most remarkable thing in this story is the name. I think
if the tale had been written down twenty-five years ago, the
name would not have occurred. I believe it to be not older
than 1870. In that year Prussia was intensely unpopular in
Ireland, owing to the sympathy felt for France; and some one,
perhaps M’Grale himself, took this method of showing his
dislike for the former country by substituting this name for
some other previously borne by the coward.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_149">Page 149.</a> “Crooked-mouth” is simply “Camp-bell,” the
order of adjective and noun—Beeăl-qam—being reversed.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_152">Page 152.</a> “Bird-Serpent”—unique, I think.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_155">Page 155.</a> “Beauty of the World.” There is nothing new
except in some of the details in this story; but the compact
energy of the style is surely remarkable as coming from an
unlettered peasant of eighty. Part of the story corresponds
with the King of Ireland’s son (Hyde’s Collection). There is
also a parallel in Curtin. With regard to the red, white, and
black incident, it is worth noting that all primitive ideas of
beauty depend on colour alone.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_156">Page 156.</a> “The red-haired young man” ought perhaps to
be “the strong young man,” in accordance with Mr. O’Grady’s
view.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_160">Pages 160</a> and <a href="#Page_164">164</a>. “Part of milk and part of blood.” The
full meaning is “one-third of milk, one-third of blood, and
one-third of urine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#Page_168">Page 168.</a> What the meaning of this strange tale may be
I cannot conjecture. It is either an allegory—the name “Grig”
(gruig) signifies churlishness—or it is a fragment of a rather
ghastly piece of mythology. Several things in the translation
are conjectural; for the Irish is full of difficulties, as the
narrator, before I began to write, warned me would be
the case.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_172">Page 172.</a> “Cornelius” is a translation of despair. The
Irish is “qornjili.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_173">Page 173.</a> The word translated “hellebore” is “dææhooh.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_174">Page 174.</a> This little tale has a close parallel in Grimm,
which is why I have printed it. There is also a version in
Kennedy.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_179">Page 179.</a> The end of the story is like Kennedy’s “Twelve
Wild Geese,” and it has also a close parallel in Grimm. But
all the earlier portion has no parallel in either.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_187">Page 187.</a> The names of the three brothers are a little
puzzling, as “Inn” seems to be only the aspirated form—the
vocative of Fionn which means fair, white; while Glégil
means Clear-Bright.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_188">Page 188.</a> This touching tale has a curious far-away resemblance
to certain classic legends. A good deal must be
lost, and in consequence the long struggle of the young man
with the devil has much that requires explanation. It is
unique among Celtic stories.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_196">Page 196.</a> “The Djachwi.” I am not sure that this word
is anything more than “deachmhadh,” a tithe, which has
been turned into a person, the meaning being forgotten.
After the briefly told Andromeda episode the story takes a
quite novel turn. Its resemblance in structure, as is the case
also with some of the other stories, to many a modern novel is
very apparent.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_203">Page 203.</a> “The skin of the wild pig.” The Irish of the
two last words is “mwike tuusjke.” I am doubtful as to the
translation which was given by M’Ginty. In the story of the
“Fate of the Children of Tuireann,” one of the tasks imposed
on the three brothers is to obtain the skin of a pig having
marvellous qualities, which has to be taken from the King of
Greece, whose name is Tuis. There appears to be some
connection.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_211">Page 211.</a> “The Red Pony.” The word translated pony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
is, in this tale, “klebisjtjïn”; in the preceding tale it is
“plebisjtjïn.” Wonderful “horse-beasts” thus occur four
times in this volume. In two stories it will be noted that they
are merely human beings, enchanted; in the other two this is
apparently not the case. The word rendered “healing water”
is, in this, as in all the other stories in which it occurs,
“ïqlæntj” (Donegal pron.), which literally means, “cure-health.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_219">Page 219.</a> “The Nine-legged Steed.” The opening resembles
a story of Curtin’s, in which, however, the stepmother
acts from the motive of hate instead of, as here, from affection.
The words translated “transforming caps” are “qahal”
(cochal), which also means a cloak, and “qantræltje,” the
translation of which is a guess. It must be inferred that of
the three maidens, who came as swans, one was the nine-legged
steed, another the lady in the greenawn. The third
is not accounted for. “Greenawn” (grïănaan) means “sunny
chamber.” In Irish tales the ladies are generally described
as occupying such apartments; a more general use of the
word is found on <a href="#Page_179">page 179</a>.</p>

<p class="center">With Numerous Illustrations by PHILIP NORMAN, F.S.A.</p>

<p class="center">With an Introduction by HENRY B. WHEATLEY, F.S.A.</p>

<p>In this volume the author has endeavoured to preserve a record, before
it is too late, of relics hitherto little known, though in their way most
interesting—namely, the Sculptured House and Street Signs, put up as a
rule immediately after the great fire, and which, when once removed, may
soon and utterly be forgotten. The author deals with their meaning,
associations, and many quaint stories relating to them.</p>

<p>The following list of the chapters will show the character and scope of
this interesting volume:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Human Signs.—Three Kings.—Astronomical Signs.—Animals
Real and Imaginary.—Birds and other Sculptured Signs.—Various
Crests and Coats of Arms.—Miscellaneous Signs, Dates
and Inscriptions, etc.—A Few Suburban Spas.—Two old City
Mansions.</span></p>

<p>The volume is incidentally full of pleasant chat concerning Old London,
its citizens and their life and surroundings in the old times. It is fully
illustrated by sketches and photographs taken on the spot by the author
himself, many of the sculptured signs particularly lending themselves to
picturesque treatment.</p>

<p>Mr. H. B. Wheatley, F.S.A., the well known authority on London, has
written an introduction to the volume, and a full index puts its stores of
information at the reader’s command.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
